## Preview

```sh
# for community
./preview.sh ce 8080

# for enterprise
./preview.sh ee 8080
```

Now, open <http://localhost:8080/docs/en/latest/> or <http://localhost:8080/en/enterprise/latest/>, if `directory.json` and `directory_ee.json` has been updated, you can re-run the above command to update the docs.

## Release a New Version

Both community and enterprise edition documents are managed in the same repo and same `release-Major.Minor` branch.

Community and Enterprise may have different content so they may release at different pace.

### Cut a new release for community edition

```sh
NEW_TAG="$(./cut-release.sh ce)"
git push origin "${NEW_TAG}"
```

### Cut a New Release for Enterprise Edition

```sh
NEW_TAG="$(./cut-release.sh ee)"
git push origin "${NEW_TAG}"
```
