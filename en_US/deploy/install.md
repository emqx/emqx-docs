## Hardware specification

Depending on the number of client connections, message rate, message size, and enabled features, the minimum hardware specification for EMQX varies.

Here we list the minimum hardware specification for running a simple EMQX function verification, with 100,000 client connections and 100,000 message throughput per second.

| Item           | Mininum configuration | Recommended configuration |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Node**       | 1                     | 2                         |
| **CPU**        | 1 core                | 16 core                   |
| **Memory**     | 512 MB                | 32 GB                     |
| **Disk space** | 1 GB                  | 50 GB                     |

::: tip

Note: In production environments, you may use our [Server Estimate](https://www.emqx.com/en/server-estimate) calculator to calculate the recommended hardware specification under various maximum connections and message throughputs.

## Files and directories

After installation, EMQX will create some directories to store running and configuration files, data, and logs. The table below lists the directories created and their file path under different installation methods:

| Directory  | Description        | Installed with tar.gz | Installed with RPM/DEB   |
| ---------- | ------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `etc`      | Config files       | `./etc`               | `/etc/emqx/etc`          |
| `data`     | Database and files | `./data`              | `/var/lib/emqx/data`     |
| `log`      | Log files          | `./log`               | `/var/log/emqx`          |
| `releases` | Boot instructions  | `./releases`          | `/usr/lib/emqx/releases` |
| `bin`      | Executables        | `./bin`               | `/usr/lib/emqx/bin`      |
| `lib`      | Erlang code        | `./lib`               | `/usr/lib/emqx/lib`      |
| `erts-*`   | Erlang runtime     | `./erts-*`            | `/usr/lib/emqx/erts-*`   |
| `plugins`  | Plugins            | `./plugins`           | `/usr/lib/emqx/plugins`  |

::: tip

1. When installed with the compressed package, the directory is relative to the directory where the software is installed;
2. When installed with Docker container, EMQX will be installed in the `/opt/emqx` directory;
3. The `data`, `log`, and `plugins` directories are configurable via the configuration files. Mounting the `data` directory to a high-performance disk is recommended for better performance.
   :::

Below will introduce the files and subfolders of some directories.

### bin directory

`bin` is the directory where all executables are stored, including:

- `emqx` and `emqx.cmd`: Executables of EMQX. For details, see [basic commands](../admin/cli.md).
- `emqx_ctl` and `emqx_ctl.cmd`: Executables of EMQX administration commands. For details, see [administration CLI commands](../admin/cli.md).

### etc directory

`etc` is the directory that holds all the configuration files, including:

- `emqx.conf`: Main configuration file for EMQX, contains all the commonly-used configuration items.
- `emqx-example-en.conf`: Demo configuration files of EMQX, contains all the configurable items;
- `acl.conf`: Default ACl rules.
- `vm.args`: Operating parameters of the Erlang virtual machine.
- `certs/`: X.509 keys and certificate files for EMQX SSL listeners, may also be used in the SSL/TLS connection when integrating with external systems.

### data directory

`data` is where EMQX stores its operating data, please ensure EMQX has read/write permissions for all files in this directory. This directory includes:

- `authz`: Stores file authorization rules uploaded by REST API or Dashboard.
- `certs`: Stores certificate files uploaded by REST API or Dashboard.
- `configs`: Stores generated config file at boot, or config overrides when changed from API or CLI.
- `mnesia`: the built-in database, one subdirectory will be generated for every node and will be named after this node, e.g., `emqx@127.0.0.1`. Note: If you need to rename a node, please delete the subdirectory named with the last name or remove it from the directory.
- `patches`: Stores the `.beam` files for EMQX to load as a hot patch. Can be used for a quick fix.
- `trace`: Online tracing log files.

In production, you should periodically backup the data directory (excluding the `trace` folder )  for data safety. Below are some key subdirectories and files within the `data` directory. 

#### mnesia

`mnesia` is a distributed database management system (DBMS) in Erlang for storing various data structures of Erlang. In EMQX documents, it is often referred to as the built-in database.

EMQX uses `Mnesia` to store its operating data, including alarm records, authentication/authorization data of the cients, Dashboard user information, etc. **If the directory is deleted, all these operating data will be lost.**

You can query the EMQX system information from `mnesia`  through the `emqx_ctl mnesia` command. For details, please see [Management Command CLI](https://docs.emqx.com/en/enterprise/v4.4/advanced/cli.html).

#### configs/app.*.config

EMQX reads the configuration in `etc/emqx.conf` and `etc/plugins/*.conf`, converts it to the Erlang native configuration file format, and reads the configuration at runtime.

The configuration items of EMQX are stored in `etc/emqx.conf`, `data/configs/cluster-override.conf`ï¼Œ and `data/configs/local-override.conf`. EMQX will read the configurations and convert them to Erlang native format so the system can apply them at runtime.

The main difference between the `data/configs` and the `etc` directory is that the `etc` directory stores read-only configuration files, while configuration updates from the Dashboard or REST API are saved in the `data/configs` directory to support hot configuration reloads at runtime.

#### trace

`trace` stores the output from the Log Trace feature for debugging and troubleshooting. For details, see [Log Trace](../observability/tracer.md).

### log directory

This directory stores the operating logs of EMQX, including

- ``emqx.log.*`: Operation logs of EMQX, for more information, see [logs](../observability/log.md).
- `erlang.log.*`: Copy file of the console log when EMQX is started in the background with `emqx start`
