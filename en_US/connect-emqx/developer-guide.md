# Developer Guide

The Developer Guide is designed to provide developers with the information to get started with EMQX and build applications on top of it.

This chapter explores the core concepts of MQTT, MQTT-specific features, and some extended features in EMQX. We will also explain how to configure these features in EMQX Dashboard and test them using client tools. The following features are covered in the guide:

- [MQTT Core Concepts](../messaging/mqtt-concepts.md)
- [Test with MQTT Clients](../messaging/publish-and-subscribe.md)
- [Shared Subscription](../messaging/mqtt-shared-subscription.md)
- [Retained Message](../messaging/mqtt-retained-message.md)
- [Will Message](../messaging/mqtt-will-message.md)
- [Exclusive Subscription](../messaging/mqtt-exclusive-subscription.md)
- [Delayed Publish](../messaging/mqtt-delayed-publish.md)
- [Auto Subscribe](../messaging/mqtt-auto-subscription.md)

EMQX's support of the MQTT protocol makes it compatible with most MQTT client libraries and SDKs. This guide also provides [step-by-step instructions and code samples](./introduction.md) to help developers quickly start building their MQTT projects. For a complete list of MQTT client SDKs and their Comparison, see [MQTT client SDKs](https://www.emqx.com/en/mqtt-client-sdk).
