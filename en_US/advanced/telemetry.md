# Telemetry

::: tip
Telemetry was added to EMQX in version 4.2-rc.1.
:::

EMQ collects information about the usage of EMQX through telemetry. This function is designed to provide us with comprehensive information about users and communities, as well as an understanding of how EMQX is used. Sharing these metrics with us can help us better understand how you use our products and can continuously help us improve our products.

These statistics do not contain individual data, such as server model, hardware number, IP address, and will never be shared with anyone else.
