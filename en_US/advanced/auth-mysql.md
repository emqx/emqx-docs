# MySQL

MySQL authentication uses an external MySQL database as the authentication data source, which can store a large amount of data and facilitate integration with external device management systems.

Plugin:

```bash
emqx_auth_mysql
```

::: tip 
The emqx_auth_mysql plugin also includes ACL feature, which can be disabled via comments
:::


To enable MySQL authentication, you need to configure the following in  `etc/plugins/emqx_auth_mysql.conf` :

## MySQL Connection information

For MySQL basic connection information, it needs to ensure that all nodes in the cluster can access.

```bash
# etc/plugins/emqx_auth_mysql.conf

## server address
auth.mysql.server = 127.0.0.1:3306

## Connection pool size
auth.mysql.pool = 8

auth.mysql.username = emqx

auth.mysql.password = public

auth.mysql.database = mqtt

auth.mysql.query_timeout = 5s
```



## Default table structure

In the default configuration of MySQL authentication, you need to ensure that the following table is in the database:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `mqtt_user` (
  `id` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `username` varchar(100) DEFAULT NULL,
  `password` varchar(100) DEFAULT NULL,
  `salt` varchar(35) DEFAULT NULL,
  `is_superuser` tinyint(1) DEFAULT 0,
  `created` datetime DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  UNIQUE KEY `mqtt_username` (`username`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4;
```



The sample data in the default configuration is as follows:

```sql
INSERT INTO `mqtt_user` ( `username`, `password`, `salt`)
VALUES
	('emqx', 'efa1f375d76194fa51a3556a97e641e61685f914d446979da50a551a4333ffd7', NULL);
```

After MySQL authentication is enabled, you can connect with username: emqx, password: public.



::: tip 
This is the table structure used by default configuration. After being familiar with the use of the plugin, you can use any data table that meets the conditions for authentication
:::



## Salting rules and hash methods

MySQL authentication support to configure [Salting rules and hash methods](./auth.md#password-salting-rules-and-hash-methods)：

```bash
# etc/plugins/emqx_auth_mysql.conf

auth.mysql.password_hash = sha256
```


## auth_query

During authentication, EMQX Broker will use the current client information to populate and execute the user-configured authentication SQL to query the client's authentication data in the database.

```bash
# etc/plugins/emqx_auth_mysql.conf

auth.mysql.auth_query = select password from mqtt_user where username = '%u' limit 1
```



You can use the following placeholders in the SQL authentication, and EMQX Broker will be automatically populated with client information when executed:

- %u：Username
- %c：Client ID
- %C：TLS certificate common name (the domain name or subdomain name of the certificate), valid only for TLS connections
- %d：TLS certificate subject, valid only for TLS connections



You can adjust the authentication SQL according to business to achieve more business-related functions, such as adding multiple query conditions and using database preprocessing functions. However, in any case, the authentication  must meet the following conditions:

1. The query result must include the password field, which is used by EMQX Broker to compare with the client password
2. If the salting configuration is enabled, the query result must include the salt field, which is used by EMQX Broker as the salt value
3. There can only be one query result. When there are multiple results, only the first one is taken as valid data.

::: tip 
You can use AS syntax in SQL to specify passwords for field renaming, or set the salt value to a fixed value
:::


## Special Instructions

For MySQL 8.0 and later version, it uses `caching_sha2_password` as the default authentication plug-in. Due to the limit of client driver, you must change it to the ` mysql_native_password` plugin:

```sql
ALTER USER 'your_username'@'your_host' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'your_password';
```
