# $SYS - System Topic

The EMQ X Broker periodically publishes its running status, message statistics, client online and offline events to the system topic starting with `$SYS/`. 

 The `$SYS` topic path begins with `$SYS/brokers/{node}/`. `{node}` is the name of the node where the event/message is generated, for example: 

```bash
$SYS/brokers/emqx@127.0.0.1/version
$SYS/brokers/emqx@127.0.0.1/uptime
```


 $SYS system message publish interval is configured in `etc/emqx.conf`: 

```bash
broker.sys_interval = 1m
```

::: danger
By default, only MQTT clients on localhost is allowed to subscribe to the $SYS topic. Please refer to [build-in ACL](./acl-file.md) to modify the ACL rules for publish and subscription.


Most of the data of the $SYS topic in EMQ X Broker can be obtained through other method with lower Couplings. The device online and offline status can be obtained through [Webhook](./webhook.md)), and the node and cluster status can be obtained through  [HTTP API - Statistics Metrics](./http-api.md#endpoint-metrics).
