# Password-based Authentication

EMQX supports the simplest and most popular password authentication, which requires the client to provide credentials that can indicate identities, such as username, client ID, and the corresponding password.

Besides the built-in database, EMQX also supports integration with various backend databases for password authentication, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis. Click the link below for more information:
