# Use Built-in Database

You can use the built-in database of EMQX as a low-cost and out-of-the-box option for password authentication. After enabling, EMQX will save the client credentials in its built-in database (based on Mnesia) and manage data via REST API and Dashboard. This page introduces how to use the EMQX Dashboard and configuration items to configure the authentication using the built-in database.

## Configure with Dashboard

You can use EMQX Dashboard to set the built-in database for password authentication.

In the EMQX Dashboard, click **Access Control** -> **Authentication** from the left navigation menu. On the **Authentication** page, click **Create** at the top right corner. Click to select **Password-Based** as **Mechanism** and **Built-in Database** as **Backend **to go to the **Configuration** tab, as shown below.

**UserID Type**: Specify the fields for client ID authentication; Options:  `username`, `clientid`ï¼ˆcorresponding to the `Username` or `Client Identifier` fields in the `CONNECT` message sent by the MQTT client).

**Password Hash**: Select the hashing function to store passwords in the database. Available options are `plain`, `md5`, `sha`, `bcrypt`, and `pbkdf2`. Additional configuration depends on your selected function:

- For `plain`, `md5`, `sha`, `sha256` or `sha512`:
   - **Salt Position**: Determines how salt (random data) is added to the password. Options are `suffix`, `prefix`, or `disable`.  You can keep the default value unless you migrate user credentials from external storage into the EMQX built-in database. Note: Set **Salt Position** to `disable` if `plain` is selected.
- For `bcrypt`:
   - **Salt Rounds**: Defines the number of times the hash function is applied, expressed as 2^Salt Rounds, also known as the "cost factor". The default value is `10`, with a permissible range of `5` to `10`. A higher value is recommended for enhanced security. Note: Increasing the cost factor by 1 doubles the necessary time for authentication.
- For `pkbdf2`: 
   - **Pseudorandom Function**: Selects the hash function that generates the key, such as `sha256`.
   - **Iteration Count**: Sets the number of times the hash function is executed. The default is `4096`.
   - **Derived Key Length** (optional): Specifies the length of the generated key. If left blank, the length will default to that determined by the selected pseudorandom function.

After you finish the settings, click **Create**.

## Configure with Configuration Items

You can also configure the authentication through configuration items. <!--For detailed steps, see [authn-builtin_db:authentication](../../configuration/configuration-manual.html#authn-builtin_db:authentication).-->

Example:

```hcl
{
   backend = "built_in_database"
   mechanism = "password_based"
   password_hash_algorithm {
      name = "sha256",
      salt_position = "suffix"
   }
   user_id_type = "username"
}
```

## Migrate from External Storage to EMQX Built-in Database

To migrate user credentials from external storage to the EMQX built-in database, you can use .csv or .json files for batch import. For operating details, see [Import User](./user_management.md#importing-users).
