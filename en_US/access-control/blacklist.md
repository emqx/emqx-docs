# Banned Client

EMQX provides users with a banning functionality.

The administrator can deny the access of clients by adding the specified clients to the banned list. In addition to the client identifier, it also supports direct ban by user names or source IP addresses.

::: tip
The banned list is only applicable to a small number of client bans. If there are a large number of clients requiring authentication management, use the [authentication](./authn/authn.md) function.

## Create Banned Clients via Dashboard

   - **Reason**: Fill in the reason why you want to ban this client in this text box.
2. Click **Create** to finish the setting.

## Flapping Clients

Based on the banned client function, EMQX automatically bans frequently logging clients to prevent them from consuming server resources that may affect other clients. Those clients will be banned for a period of time.

It should be noted that the automatic ban only bans the client by the identifier, not by the user name and IP address. That is to say, a malicious client may still be able to attack if they change the client identifier for each attempt.

This feature is disabled by default, and users can enable it by adding the following configuration to the `emqx.conf` file:

```bash
flapping_detect {

  enable = true

  ## The max disconnect allowed of an MQTT Client in `window_time`
  max_count = 15

  ## The time window for flapping detect
  window_time = 1m

  ## How long the clientid will be banned
  ban_time = 5m

}
```
These settings may be specified individually for each zone.
