# LwM2M Protocol Gateway

## Protocol Introduction

LwM2M (Lightweight Machine-To-Machine) is a protocol from the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) for machine to machine (M2M) or Internet of things device (IoT), it provides device management and communication functions, especially suitable for terminal devices with limited resources.

For more information, see [OMA SpecWorks](http://openmobilealliance.org/iot/lightweight-m2m-lwm2m.)

LwM2M is built on [Constrained Application Protocol](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7252) (CoAP), carried over UDP or SMS, based on REST architecture,
so the message structure is simple and compact to worker better in environments where network resources are limited and the device is not always online.

There are two roles in the LwM2M protocol:

- LwM2M Server

  LwM2M has two kind services:

  1. LwM2M bootstrap server. The `emqx-lwm2m` plugin does not implement this server.
  2. LwM2M server. The `emqx-lwm2m` plugin implement it over UDP/DTLS (but not over TCP/TLS, nor over SMS).

- LwM2M Client

    An LwM2M client is deployed on an LwM2M device which connects to the server for machine to machine communication.

Between LwM2M Server and LwM2M Client, the LwM2M protocol defines 4 interfaces.

1. Bootstrap interface

    This interface is to provide the client with necessary server information (such as server access point) for it to register to the server. The client also makes use of this interface to provide information (such as supported resources) to the server.

2. Client Registration Interface

     The client registers itself to the server, and the server stores the information about the connection for future use. Communication between client and server is only possible after registration is completed.

3. Device management and service implementation interface

    Allows the server to access and modify LwM2M client object instances and resources.

4. Information reporting interface

    Allows the server to subscribe resource information to the client, and the client reports its resource changes to the server in agreed mode.

LwM2M abstracts the services on the device as `Object`s and `Resource`s, and defines the attributes and functionalities of various objects in XML files. See
[Here](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/wp/OMNA/LwM2M/LwM2MRegistry.html) for details.


The LwM2M protocol predefines 8 kinds of objects, namely:

  - Security object
  - Server object
  - Access Control access control object
  - Device object
  - Connectivity Monitoring Connectivity monitoring object
  - Firmware firmware object
  - Location object
  - Connectivity Statistics Connectivity statistics object

EMQX-LwM2M is a gateway module of EMQX server, it implements most of the functionalities of LwM2M. MQTT client can access LwM2M-enabled devices through EMQX-LWM2M and devices can also report notification to EMQX-LwM2M for data collection and integration over MQTT protocol.

### Configuration parameters

## MQTT and LwM2M conversion

With `emqx_lwm2m`, user is able to send LwM2M commands(READ/WRITE/EXECUTE/...) and get LwM2M response in MQTT way. `emqx_lwm2m` transforms data between MQTT and LwM2M protocol.

emqx_lwm2m needs object definitions to parse data from lwm2m devices. Object definitions are declared by organizations in XML format, you could find those XMLs from [LwM2MRegistry](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/wp/OMNA/LwM2M/LwM2MRegistry.html), download and put them into the directory specified by `lwm2m.xml_dir`. If no associated object definition is found, response from device will be discarded and report an error message in log.

### Register/Update (LwM2M Client Registration Interface)

- **LwM2M Register and Update message will be converted to following MQTT message:**

  - **Method:** PUBLISH
  - **Topic:** `lwm2m/{?EndpointName}/up/resp` (configurable, `Mountpoint` + `Register/Update` Topic. The same rules apply to other conversion topics)
  - **Payload**:
    - MsgType **register** and **update**:
      ```json

### MQTT and LwM2M conversion

From the MQTT client, you can send Command to the LwM2M device. The command from MQTT to LwM2M uses the following topic

```bash
"lwm2m/{?device_end_point_name}/command".
```

The MQTT Payload is a string in json format, which specifies the command to be sent. For more details, please refer to the emqx-lwm2m documentation.

The reply of the LwM2M device is sent with the following topic

```bash
"lwm2m/{?device_end_point_name}/response".
```

MQTT Payload is also a string in json format. For more details, please refer to the documentation of emqx-lwm2m.

:::
The EMQX LwM2M gateway only supports the following content-formats in the CoAP messages:
- "text/plain"
- "application/octet-stream"
- "application/vnd.oma.lwm2m+tlv"
- "application/vnd.oma.lwm2m+json"
