# MQTT retainer message

## Introduction

When the server receives a PUBLISH message with the Retain flag of 1, it will treat the message as a retainer message. In addition to being forwarded normally, the retainer message will be stored on the server. Only one retainer message can exist under each topic. , So if there is already a retainer message with the same topic, the retainer message is replaced.

When the client establishes a subscription, if there are retainer messages with matching topics on the server, these retainer messages will be sent to the client immediately. With the help of retained messages, new subscribers can immediately obtain the latest status without waiting for an unexpected time, which is very important in many scenarios.
