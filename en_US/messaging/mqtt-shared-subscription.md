# MQTT Shared Subscription

EMQX implements the shared subscription feature of MQTT. A shared subscription is a subscription mode to implement load balancing among multiple subscribers. Clients can be divided into multiple subscription groups, and messages are still forwarded to all subscription groups, but only one client within each subscription group receives the message at a time. You can add a prefix to the original topic to enable a shared subscription for multiple subscribers. EMQX supports shared subscription prefixes in two formats: shared subscription for groups (prefixed with `$share/<group-name>/`) and shared subscription not for groups (prefixed with `$queue/`).

Examples of two shared subscription prefixes formats are as follows.

| Prefixes formats                  | Example        | Prefix      | Real topic name |
| --------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| Shared subscription for groups    | $share/abc/t/1 | $share/abc/ | t/1             |
| Shared subscription not for group | $queue/t/1     | $queue/     | t/1             |

You can use client tools to connect to EMQX and try this messaging service. This section introduces how shared subscription works and provides a demonstration of how to use the [MQTTX Desktop](https://mqttx.app/) and [MQTTX CLI](https://mqttx.app/cli) to simulate clients and try the shared subscription feature.

## Shared Subscription for Groups

You can enable a shared subscription for groups of subscribers by adding the prefixed `$share/<group-name>` to the original topic. The group name can be any string. EMQX forwards messages to different groups at the same time and subscribers belonging to the same group receive messages with load balancing.

For example, if subscribers `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` are members of group `g1`, subscribers `s4` and `s5` are members of group `g2`, and all subscribers subscribe to the original topic `t1`. The shared subscription topics must be `$share/g1/t1` and `$share/g2/t1`. When EMQX publishes a message `msg1` to the original topic `t1`:

- EMQX sends `msg1` to both groups `g1` and `g2`.
- Only one of `s1`, `s2`, `s3` will receive `msg1`.
- Only one of `s4` and `s5` will receive `msg1`.

## Shared Subscription Not for Groups

Shared subscription topics prefixed with `$queue/` are for subscribers not in groups. It is a special case of a shared subscription topic with a `$share` prefix. You can understand it as all subscribers in a subscription group such as `$share/$queue`.

## Shared Subscription and Session

The concept of shared subscription and the use of a persistent session in MQTT clients presents a contradiction, making it impossible to use both features simultaneously. If you are using the shared subscription functionality, it is essential to enable the clean session feature on the client by setting the `clean_session` parameter to `true`.

The persistent session (`clean_session=false`) feature ensures that subscribers can resume data flow immediately after reconnecting without losing any messages. This is vital for maintaining reliable message delivery. By setting the `clean_session` parameter to `false`, the session persists even when the client goes offline, allowing the device to continue receiving messages. However, since the device is offline, it may not process the received messages promptly, leading to a potential accumulation of messages within the session over time.

When the shared subscription is enabled and another device within the same group takes over the data flow of the offline device, it won't receive any of the accumulated messages because they are considered part of the session of the original device. Consequently, if the device remains offline for an extended period, the message buffer of the persistent session could overflow, resulting in message loss. This situation can disrupt load balancing and eventually lead to the depletion of memory and storage resources, negatively impacting the system's stability and overall performance.

## Try Shared Subscription with MQTTX Desktop

:::tip Prerequisites

- Knowledge about MQTT [Shared Subscription](./mqtt-concepts.md#shared-subscription)
- Basic publishing and subscribing operations using [MQTTX](./publish-and-subscribe.md)

:::

The following procedure demonstrates how to add a `$share` prefix to the original topic so that subscribers in different groups can share the subscription to the same topic and receive the messages from the shared subscription.

In this demonstration, you can create one client connection `demo` as a publisher to publish messages to the topic `t/1`. Then, you can create 4 client connections as subscribers, such as `Subscriber1`, `Subscriber2`, `Subscriber3`, and `Subscriber4`.  The subscribers can be divided into groups `a` and `b`, and both groups subscribe to the topic `t/1`.

1. Start EMQX and MQTTX Desktop. Click the **New Connection** to create a client connection as a publisher.

   - Enter `Demo` in the **Name** field.
   - Enter the localhost `127.0.0.1` in **Host** to use as an example in this demonstration.
   - Leave other settings as default and click **Connect**.

   ::: tip

   More detailed instructions on creating an MQTT connection are introduced in [MQTTX Desktop](./publish-and-subscribe.md#mqttx-desktop).

2. Click the **New Connection** to create 4 new connections as subscribers. Set **Name** set to `Subscriber1`, `Subscriber2,` `Subscriber3`, and `Subscriber4` respectively.

3. Select the `Subscriber` connections one at a time in the **Connections** pane and click **New Subscription** to create a shared subscription for each subscriber. Enter the correct topic in the **Topic** text box by referring to the rules below.

   To form a group for multiple subscribers, you need to add group name `{group}` before the subscribed topic `t/1`. To make them all subscribe to the same topic, you need to add the prefix `$share` before the group name.

   In the **New Subscription** window:

   - Set the **Topic** to `$share/a/t/1` for `Subscribe1` and `Subscriber2`.
   - Set the **Topic** to `$share/b/t/1` for `Subscriber3` and `Subscriber4`.

   In these example topics:

   - The prefix `$share` indicates this is a shared subscription.
   - `{group}` is `a` and `b`, but it can be any customized name.
   - `t/1` indicates the original topic name.

   Leave other settings as default. Click the **Confirm** button.

5. Click the connection `Demo` you created before.

   - Send a message with the topic `t/1`. The client `Subscriber1` in group `a` and `Subscriber4` in gourd `b` should receive the message.

     <img src="./assets/Receive-message-shared-subscription1.png" alt="Receive-message-shared-subscription1" style="zoom:35%;" />

   - Send the same message again. The client `Subscriber2` in group `a` and `Subscriber3` in group `b` should receive the message.

     <img src="./assets/Receive-message-shared-subscription2.png" alt="Receive-message-shared-subscription2" style="zoom:35%;" />

:::tip

When the message of the shared subscription is published, the EMQX forwards the message to different groups at the same time, but only one of the subscribers in the same group receives the message at a time.

## Try Shared Subscription with MQTTX CLI

1. Four subscribers are divided into 2 groups and subscribe to topic  `t/1`:

   ```bash
   # Client A and B subscribe to topic `$share/my_group1/t/1`
   mqttx sub -t '$share/my_group1/t/1' -h 'localhost' -p 1883

   ## Client C and D subscribe to topic  `$share/my_group2/t/1`
   mqttx sub -t '$share/my_group2/t/1' -h 'localhost' -p 1883
   ```

2. Use a new client to publish 4 messages with payloads `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4` to the original topic `t/1`:

   ```bash
   mqttx pub -t 't/1' -m '1' -h 'localhost' -p 1883
   mqttx pub -t 't/1' -m '2' -h 'localhost' -p 1883
   mqttx pub -t 't/1' -m '3' -h 'localhost' -p 1883
   mqttx pub -t 't/1' -m '4' -h 'localhost' -p 1883
   ```

3. Check the message received by the clients within each subscription group:

   - Subscription group 1 (A and B) and subscription group 2 (C and D) simultaneously receive the messages.
   - Only one of the subscribers in the same group receives the message at a time.
