## Running

EMQX Dashboard is a web application that listens to port `18083` by default. After installing EMQX successfully, you can access and use EMQX Dashboard by opening <http://localhost:18083/> (replace localhost with the actual IP address if deployed on a non-local machine) through your browser.

::: tip
EMQX can still be used normally without Dashboard enabled, Dashboard just provides the option for users to use it visually.
:::

### First Login

For users who have installed EMQX for the first time, you can use the default username `admin` and default password `public` to login web page after opening the Dashboard in your browser.

After logging in for the first time, the system will automatically detect that you are logging in with the default username and password, and will force you to change the default password, which is good for the security of accessing Dashboard, note that the changed password cannot be the same as the original password, and it is not recommended to use `public` as the login password again.

## Reset password

You can reset your Dashboard login password via the `admins` command. For details, see [CLI - admins](../admin/cli.md#admins).

```bash
./bin/emqx ctl admins passwd <Username> <Password>
```
