# Releases

## 4.4.25

*Release Date: 2024-09-13*

### Enhancements

- Introduced a username quota limitation module to restrict the number of sessions that a single MQTT username can log in with.

  This feature can be configured in the Dashboard under **Modules** -> **Username Quota**. In the **Configuration** tab, you can add a username white list, where usernames in the white list will not be subject to quota restrictions.

  Note that if this feature is enabled, a whitelist must be used to bypass the username quota restrictions for MQTT bridging.

- Improved error log when an illegal Will QoS value is carried in the CONNECT message when using the MQTT 3.1.1 protocol.

- Enhanced performance for sending messages to Redis.

  Previously, due to the limitations of the `gen_tcp:send/2` implementation, as more messages piled up in the Redis Client process’s send queue, the sending performance would gradually decrease. Thus, under high message traffic, the Redis Client process could become a system bottleneck.

  This optimization improves the sending performance of Redis Authentication/ACL, Redis Plugin, and Redis Rule Engine resources. For Redis authentication functionality, it relieves the pressure during mass device reconnections after a service interruption.

- Enhanced performance for sending messages to SysKeeper.

  Previously, due to the limitations of the `gen_tcp:send/2` implementation, as more messages piled up in the `emqx_bridge_sysk_forward` process’s send queue, the sending performance would gradually decrease. Thus, under high message traffic, the `emqx_bridge_sysk_forward` process could become a system bottleneck.

- Increased the file size limit for a single log trace from 512MB to 1GB.

- Improved the ACL feature in the "Internal DB AUTH/ACL" module.

  - You can now set a limit on the number of ACL entries for a single client in the built-in ACL module.

    When publishing or subscribing to a topic, ACL validation requires traversing the client’s ACL entries. Therefore, adding too many ACL entries for a single client could degrade the performance of publishing or subscribing. You can now limit the number of ACL entries added for a single client using the `auth.mnesia.max_acls_for_each_login` configuration item or the `Max ACLs"`parameter in the module.

  - Enhanced the matching performance of the built-in ACL module.

    By optimizing the storage structure of the ACL table and the topic matching logic, the performance of searching and matching ACL entries in the built-in ACL module has been improved. The more ACL entries a single client has, the more significant the performance improvement.

  - Added/removed ACL entries in the built-in ACL module will now reset the ACL cache.

- The rule engine's batch sending process now supports overload protection.

  When batch sending is enabled, the rule engine creates a group of processes to buffer and batch send messages for actions. If asynchronous sending mode is used, when the external database response is too slow, messages may pile up in the batch process’s message queue, posing a risk of exceeding system memory limits. Now, the batch sending function of the rule engine will be limited by overload protection. When the message queue size exceeds `"Maximum Batch Size" * 10` (if the value of `"Maximum Batch Size" * 10` is less than 1000, then the minimum message queue size is 1000), the action will be "unloaded" for a period of time (default 60 seconds). During this time, subsequent messages sent to the action will be discarded, and the `action_olp_blocked/<RuleID>/<ActionID>` alarm will be triggered.

  Actions subject to overload protection:

  - Data to Cassandra
  - Data to ClickHouse
  - Data to DolphinDB
  - Data to InfluxDB
  - Data to IoTDB
  - Data to Lindorm
  - Data to MySQL
  - Data to Oracle Database
  - Data to PostgreSQL
  - Data to SQLServer
  - Data to Tablestore
  - Data to TDengine
  - Data to GCP Pubsub

- Added support for inserting undefined values as `NULL` into databases.

  Various database actions in the rule engine support constructing insert statements using `${var}` placeholders. Previously, if a placeholder variable was undefined, the rule engine might insert the string `undefined` into the database. Now, a new option `Insert Undefined Values as NULL` has been added to the database-related actions, allowing `NULL` to be inserted into the database when a variable is undefined.

  Actions supporting this option:

  - Data to Cassandra
  - Data to ClickHouse
  - Data to DolphinDB
  - Data to MySQL
  - Data to Oracle Database
  - Data to PostgreSQL
  - Data to SQLServer
  - Data to TDengine

- Added support for log throttling.

  When certain abnormal situations occur, a large number of repetitive (similar content) logs may be generated, increasing system load and potentially overshadowing other useful log information. Now, you can configure a time window and maximum log rate within that window using the `log.throttling` setting in the `etc/logger.conf` file.

  Note that to improve the efficiency of the throttling function, EMQX will start N throttlers, where N is the number of CPU cores. This means that if `log.throttling = 50,60s` is set, each throttler will restrict the logging of the same message (determined by the log’s module name and line number) to a maximum of 50 times per minute. Assuming 8 CPU cores, the system could log between 50 and 400 messages per minute depending on Erlang VM process scheduling. If logs are dropped by the throttler, EMQX will log a message indicating the number of logs that were dropped:

  ```
  log throttled during last 60s, dropped_msg: #{{emqx_channel,1400} => #{msg => "Client ~s (Username: '~s') login failed for ~0p", count => 33}}
  ```

  This log indicates that in the last 60 seconds, 33 logs from line 1400 of the `emqx_channel` module were dropped by EMQX.

  This feature is enabled by default for warning and higher log levels, with a default setting of `50,60s`.

- Added support for configuring HTTP/HTTPS management interface timeouts.

  Two timeout-related configurations have been added to the `etc/plugins/emqx_management.conf` file:

  - `management.listener.<Proto>.request_timeout`: Specifies the time after establishing a TCP connection within which the server will close the connection if no HTTP request is received. The default is 5 seconds.
  - `management.listener.<Proto>.idle_timeout`: Specifies the idle timeout period. After receiving at least one HTTP request on the connection, if no further requests are received, the server will close the connection after the specified time. The default is 60 seconds.

  Here, `<Proto>` can be `http` or `https`.

- Added validation for the target topic in the "Republish" action.

  After the improvement, when the "Republish" action sends a message, it will validate the legality of the target topic. If the topic is a non-UTF-8 encoded binary, the action will fail.

- Optimized the performance of the Redis-Cluster driver.

  This optimization reduces the memory footprint of EMQX when accessing Redis Cluster. The following features benefit from this optimization:

  - Redis Authentication/ACL
  - Redis Plugin
  - Redis Actions in the Rule Engine

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where sending messages exceeding Kafka server's maximum message size limit would cause the Kafka Producer to become blocked.

  Previously, when a single message exceeded the `message.max.bytes` configured on the Kafka server, the Kafka Producer's send queue in the rule engine would become blocked, and subsequent messages would be buffered until reaching the maximum cache limit set by `Max Cache Bytes`. Now, if a single message exceeds the `Max Batch Bytes` limit configured in the rule engine's Kafka resource, the Kafka Producer will discard the message to prevent queue blockage.

- Fixed an issue where the "resource down" alarm could not be cleared in certain situations.

- Fixed an issue where the `timestamp` field value was incorrect in rules triggered by Will messages. The field value should represent the time the rule was triggered, not the client's connection time.

- Fixed an issue where the Kafka action failed to send data when `username` was used as the `Message Key`.

  Previously, if the Kafka `Message Key` was set to `username` but the MQTT client did not provide a username at login, the Kafka Producer would fail to send the message. After the fix, for messages without a username, the Kafka Producer will use the string `undefined` as the Message Key.

- Fixed an issue where the rule engine failed to trigger the `$events/client_disconnected` event when a process terminated unexpectedly.

- Fixed an issue where the DynamoDB action failed to send data when `clientid` was set as the `Hash Key`.

- Fixed an issue which may cause shared-subscription sticky strategy degrading into random after node restart.

## 4.4.24

*Release Date: 2024-04-16*

### Enhancements

- Make `/load_rebalance/availability_check` public, i.e. not requiring authentication. This simplifies load balancer setup. Also make this API method maximally lightweight to avoid possible overloading the broker.

- Made rebalance/evacuation more graceful during the wait health check phase. The connections to nodes
  marked for eviction are now not prohibited during this phase.

  During this phase it is unknown whether these nodes are all marked unhealthy by the load balancer, so prohibiting connections to them may cause multiple unsuccessful attempts to reconnect.

- Improved the issue of a too short Idle Timeout for the HTTP API.

  Previously, the `idle_timeout` for the HTTP API was set to 5 seconds. If the HTTP API did not receive any requests within 5 seconds, the TCP connection of HTTP would be closed by EMQX. This change increases the HTTP API's `idle_timeout` to 60 seconds.

- Enhanced the descriptions of certain configuration fields and options.

  * Improved descriptions of the `Base URL` and `Path` parameters in Webhook resources and actions.
  * Enhanced the description of the `idle_timeout` configuration for WS/WSS listeners in hot configurations.
  * Improved the detailed description of the `Max Returned Count` parameter in offline message-related actions.
  * Renamed the English parameter `Key` in ClickHouse resources to `Password`.
  * Renamed the `PartitionKey` parameter in HStreamDB actions to `Partition Key`.
  * Updated the detailed description of the `Maximum Retained Message Size` parameter in the Retainer module from `0B` to `0`.
  * Renamed `Message Interception` to `Intercept Empty Messages` in the Retainer module and improved its description.

- Checked the value ranges and validity of certain configuration options.

  * Checked that the `mqtt.max_topic_levels`, `mqtt.max_packet_size`, `keepalive_backoff` configuration options must be non-negative.
  * When starting SSL listeners, checked the dependencies of the `verify_peer`, `fail_if_no_peer_cert`, and `cacertfile` parameters. Previously, this check only occurred when SSL clients attempted to establish a connection.
  * Checked that the `acceptors`, `max_connections`, `max_conn_rate`, and `active_n` parameters in listener configurations must be non-negative.
  * Checked that the `Heartbeat Interval` and `Automatic Reconnection Interval` parameters in RabbitMQ resources must be correct time length strings.
  * Fixed an issue where duplicate ports were not checked for GB/T 32960 and JT/T808 listeners.
  * Fixed an issue in the GB/T 32960 and JT/T808 gateway configurations where certain parameter values were not validated.

- Optimized log formats and addressed some display issues on the Dashboard.

  * Improved the precision of rule engine rate values occasionally showing very long floating-point numbers on the Dashboard, now accurate to two decimal places.
  * In the alert messages for system resource usage, the CPU usage value is now precise to two decimal places.
  * Removed debug fields like `mfa` from logs.

- Rule engine now supports user-defined SQL functions.

  Assuming a user-customized plugin contains a module named `emqx_rule_funcs1` with a function named `func`, in the rule engine, users can use it like this:

  ```SQL
  SELECT emqx_rule_funcs1.func() FROM "t/#"
  ```

  Note that the module name must be prefixed with either `emqx_rule_funcs` or `EmqxRuleFuncs`.

- The Kafka consumer group module now supports more authentication methods.

  Now, the Kafka consumer group module supports multiple authentication methods, including PLAIN, SCRAM_SHA_256, and KERBEROS, just like Kafka resources.

- Added overload protection for certain HTTP API methods that consume more system resources.

  * The `GET /api/v4/clients/*` related APIs
  * The `GET /api/v4/routes` API
  * The `GET /api/v4/subscriptions` API
  * The `GET /api/v4/rules` API
  * The `GET /api/v4/banned` API
  * The `GET /api/v4/audits` API
  * APIs for searching usernames and client IDs in the built-in authentication module.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the `date_to_unix_ts()` SQL function in the rule engine returns an incorrect value when the input date is a leap year.

- During node evacuation, evacuate all disconnected sessions, not only those started with `clean_start` set to `false`.

  Before the fix, if the client sets `clean_start = true` and a non-zero `Session-Expiry-Interval`, the session will not be evacuated, resulting in the loss of the session after the node is closed.

- Fixed the Redis authentication exception when corresponding authentication information is not found in Redis.

- Fixed the exception caused by uninitialized ETS table during the startup process of an EMQX node when accessing the HTTP API.

- Fixed the issue of failing to load extension plugins under certain circumstances.

  The `plugins.expand_plugins_dir` configuration can specify a directory where EMQX will search for and load plugins during startup.
  Under certain circumstances, plugin files may be loaded multiple times, causing EMQX to fail to start.

- Fixed the issue of being unable to clear the ACL cache for a single client using the command line.

  Previously, the command `emqx ctl acl cache-clean 'mqttx_458d5222'` did not work.

- Fixed the problem where fuzzy searches on the rule list, built-in authentication/authorization list pages did not show more pagination, causing incomplete data display.

- Fixed the inaccurate error logs printed by EMQX when attempting to download trace log files in the "waiting to start" state.

- Fixed the issue with the SSL listener configuration during the first use of the hot configuration feature, where the `backlog` configuration item was displayed as empty and required, causing form submission failure.

  After the fix, the `backlog` configuration is made optional with a default value of 1024.

- Fixed the issue where validators related to `zone` in the configured `emqx.schema` file were not effective.

- Fixed the problem in the response of the audit log query API, where the `operation_result` field remained `success` even when the HTTP Status Code for the queried information was 500.

- Fixed the issue of duplicate GB/T 32960 client IDs on the Dashboard.

## 4.4.23

*Release Date: 2023-11-24*

### Enhancements

- Improved the performance of message sending between EMQX nodes.

  `gen_rpc` is the RPC channel used internally by EMQX for sending MQTT messages between nodes. In this improvement, we optimized the `gen_rpc`'s ability to handle backlogged messages in the channel, allowing the system to recover more quickly from traffic peaks.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue that the rule engine could not connect to [upstash](https://upstash.com/) Redis.

  Before the fix, after establishing a TCP connection with the Redis service, the Redis driver of emqx used [Inline Commands](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec/#inline-commands) to send AUTH and SELECT commands. However, the upstash Redis service did not support Inline Commands, which caused the rule engine to fail to connect to the upstash Redis service.
  After the fix, the redis driver of emqx uses RESP (REdis Serialization Protocol) to send AUTH and SELECT commands.

- Added validity check for some parameters of the "Offline Msg to Redis" action and Redis resource.

  - Checked the "Redis Key TTL" parameter of the "Offline Msg to Redis" action.
  - Checked the "Redis Database" parameter of the Redis resource.

## 4.4.22

*Release Date: 2023-11-01*

### Enhancements

- Added the Audit Log feature to track important operation changes.

  - To enable the Audit Log, click **General** -> **Audit Log** -> **Enable** on Dashboard, modify the parameters, and click **Add**.
  - Once enabled, all HTTP requests except `GET` and CLI executions will be recorded.
  - The most recent 5,000 audit log entries are visible by default in the Dashboard, while the complete log file is stored in the `data/audit` directory.

- Added support for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) roles in the dashboard. With this new functionality, users can be assigned one of two roles: "Administrator" or "Viewer" when logging into the Dashboard, each with distinct permissions.

  - Administrator Role: Administrators enjoy unrestricted access, granting them full control over all aspects of the dashboard's functionality.
  - Viewer Role: Viewers are limited to read-only access. They can view dashboard information but are unable to make any modifications.

  RBAC ensures that the right users have the appropriate level of access, simplifying user management and access control and enhancing security and data integrity.

- LwM2M gateway supported sending downlink data using Block Wise Transfer.

- Added the new SQL functions: map_keys(), map_values(), map_to_entries(), join_to_string(), join_to_string(), join_to_sql_values_string(), is_null_var(), is_not_null_var().

  For more information on the functions and their usage, refer to the documentation.

- Added `Forward QoS` configuration option for the action of "Data bridge to MQTT Broker" to specify the QoS level of messages to be forwarded through the MQTT bridge.

- Added support for specifying the expiration time of MQTT messages via configuration file.

  See the description of the `mqtt.message_expiry_interval` configuration in the `emqx.conf` file for more details.

- Updated Erlang/OTP version to OTP-24.3.4.2-4.

- Added schema validations for better configuring OCSP Stapling and CRL Check consistency.

### Bug Fixes

- Resolved the issue causing the Kafka client (wolff) producer to crash.

  This problem occurred when a Kafka resource was inadvertently deleted during the initialization of certain rules, leading to a failure in the dependent rules. This error then propagated, triggering an error escalation mechanism, leading to the crash of all rules. The resolution prevents this propagation, ensuring the system stability.
  
- Fixed the issue that GBT32960 gateway module could not parse the `retry_interval` parameter.

- Fixed the issue that GBT32960 client was unable to fetch through the HTTP API.

- Fixed the issue that exception logs appeared when the OCPP client failed in authentication.

- Fixed the issue that OCPP gateway did not validate an empty ClientID.

- Upgraded RabbitMQ driver and fixed some security vulnerabilities.

- Fixed the issue with the GCP PubSub action in the rule engine, where the statistics counter did not increase in asynchronous sending mode.

- Fixed the issue that only the resources of the current node would reconnect when manually reconnecting resources.

- Fixed the issue that the statistics counter of actions was not reset after deleting and reimporting rules.

- Fixed the issue in cluster mode where restarting rules would result in an action resource leak.

  Before the fix, when stopping and starting rules, the action resource (some processes associated with the actions) leaked if the action creation failed on certain nodes.

- Fixed the issue of reduced performance in some data integration actions with batch mode in multi-CPU scenarios compared to versions before 4.4.5.

  In version 4.4.5, the number of workers in the batch process pool was modified to `number of CPU cores * 4`. When running on machines with a higher number of CPU cores, this resulted in an excessive number of worker processes, causing each process to accumulate relatively few messages within the specified batch time. This, in turn, led to a decrease in the performance of batch data sending.

  The fix no longer hardcodes the number of workers in the batch process pool. Instead, it introduces a new configuration option called `batch_pool_size`, with a default value of 8.

  The data integration actions affected are: data_to_cassa, data_to_clickhouse, data_to_influxdb, data_to_iotdb, data_to_lindorm, data_to_mysql, data_to_oracle, data_to_pgsql, data_to_sqlserver, data_to_tablestore, data_to_tdengine, data_to_gcp_pubsub.

- Fixed an issue in the MQTT bridge that sending QoS2 messages failed when using the MQTT 5.0 protocol.

- Fixed the issue that hot configuration updates failed when the configuration for a listener in the configuration file was missing.

- Fixed the issue of LwM2M gateway plugin startup failure.

  Before the fix, if the LwM2M module was first shut down and then the LwM2M plugin was started, it would result in a plugin startup failure. The log message was as follows:

  ```
  {emqx_lwm2m,{bad_return,{{emqx_lwm2m_app,start,[normal,[]]},{'EXIT',{{already_started,<0.3895.177>},[...]}}}}}
  ```

- Fixed the issue that the shared subscription topic prefix on the Dashboard was not displayed correctly.

  Before the fix, topics like `$share/g//t` would be displayed as `/t` on the client details page of the Dashboard, causing the shared subscription prefix to be lost. After the fix, it will be displayed correctly as `$share/g//t`.

- Added a `none` option for `peer_cert_as_username` and `peer_cert_as_clientid` in the configuration file. These two options are used to use (client) certificate content as the username/ClientID.

- Fixed the issue of occasional listener restarts when enabling hot configuration feature.

- Fixed the issue that errors occurred when stopping actively running rules.

  Before the fix, manually stopping actively running rules occasionally resulted in error logs like the following, indicating that the action was not properly initialized or had been cleared:

  ```
  foo@x.x.x.x:54663 Rule: <<"rule:ba48182b">>; Action: data_to_kafka; Resource: <<"resource:7bacacdc">>. Continue next action, reason: {error,{badmatch,not_found}, ...
  ```

  After the fix, such error logs are no longer generated, and error logs for uninitiated actions in other cases have been optimized.

- Fixed the issue of DTLS PSK handshake failure in the LwM2M gateway.

- Added checks for illegal fields in the retainer module's configuration.

  Added checks for the `Max Retained Messages` and `Max Retained Payload Size` fields to ensure they are non-negative values.

- Fixed the issue of failing to send messages to TDEngine after hot update.

- Fixed the issue of RabbitMQ resources becoming unavailable after hot update.

- Canceled the HTTP refresh timer of the OCSP when disabling OCSP stapling or the TLS listener.

- Canceled the CRL refresh timer when disabling CRL check or the TLS listener.

## 4.4.21

*Release Date: 2023-10-16*

### Enhancements

- Added support for Confluent data bridge.

- Now the MQTT topic field in the Kafka consumer group supports templates with placeholders.

  For example, if the key of the message consumed by Kafka is "a", and the configured MQTT topic is "topic/${key}", then the MQTT topic will be replaced with "topic/a" when the message is forwarded.

- Now the "Message Republish" action supports two new fields: "MQTT Properties" and "User Properties". Both of the fields are in the format of key-value pairs, and both the key and value support placeholders.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue that the Kafka action cannot send numeric values as Kafka Headers.

  Prior to this fix, when the "Kafka Headers value encode mode" was set to "NONE", if the "Kafka Headers" field contains a JSON object with numeric types (such as `{"a": 1, "b": "str"}`), the numeric values (`"a":1`) would be ignored and not sent to Kafka. After the fix, the numeric types in JSON will be converted to strings before being sent to Kafka.

## 4.4.20

*Release Date: 2023-08-01*

### Enhancements

- Improved the performance of sending data to Kafka and HStreamDB.

  This enhancement added an Erlang message buffer ahead of the driver process, reducing the frequency of internal message passing within EMQX. This optimization comes at the expense of increased message latency, but it significantly enhances the throughput capacity when sending data to Kafka and HStreamDB.

  Now, messages sent from EMQX to Kafka or HStreamDB drivers will first enter the buffer. When the number of cached messages reaches `message_accumulation_size` or the time interval reaches `message_accumulation_interval`, the buffered messages will be batched and sent to the Kafka or HStreamDB driver. The driver will then handle the forwarding to Kafka or HStreamDB services. Setting `message_accumulation_size = 0` (default value) will disable this message buffering feature.

- Added the `auto_reconnect` option for SQL Server resources.

  Before this improvement, when the connection between EMQX and the SQL Server database was disrupted, EMQX was unable to reconnect automatically. With this new enhancement, EMQX can reconnect automatically. You can still opt to set `auto_reconnect = false` to turn off the automatic reconnection feature.

- Added TLS connection support to RabbitMQ resource.

- Added support for defining attributes and ordering key for GCP PubSub actions.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue that the `mongo_date()` function of the rule engine cannot be tested on the Dashboard.

  Before the fix, `mongo_date()` can be used normally, but an error will occur when testing on the SQL test page of the Dashboard.

- Fixed the issue where the rule engine failed to send messages through RabbitMQ actions after a hot upgrade to version 4.4.19.

## 4.4.19

*Release Date: 2023-06-27*

### Enhancements

- Added support for TCP keep-alive in MQTT/TCP and MQTT/SSL listeners [#10854](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10854).

  A new configuration option has been added: `zone.<zone-name>.tcp_keepalive = Idle,Interval,Probes`. Users can enable the TCP layer's Keep Alive feature and specify time parameters using this configuration. This configuration is only effective on Linux and MacOS systems.

- Improved error logs related to Proxy Protocol [emqx/esockd#177](https://github.com/emqx/esockd/pull/177).

  The sample logs before this improvement:

  ```
  2023-04-20T14:56:51.671735+08:00 [error] supervisor: 'esockd_connection_sup - <0.2537.0>', errorContext: connection_shutdown, reason: {invalid_proxy_info,<<"f\n">>}, offender: [{pid,<0.3192.0>},{name,connection},{mfargs,{...}}]

  2023-04-20T14:57:01.348275+08:00 [error] supervisor: 'esockd_connection_sup - <0.2537.0>', errorContext: connection_shutdown, reason: {proxy_proto_timeout,5000}, offender: [{pid,<0.3194.0>},{name,connection},{mfargs,{...}}]
  ```

  After the improvement:

  ```
  2023-04-20T18:07:06.180134+08:00 [error] [esockd_proxy_protocol] The listener 127.0.0.1:8883 is working in proxy protocol mode, but received invalid proxy_protocol header, raw_bytes=<<"f\n">>

  2023-04-20T18:10:17.205436+08:00 [error] [esockd_proxy_protocol] The listener 127.0.0.1:8883 is working in proxy protocol mode, but timed out while waiting for proxy_protocol header
  ```

- Added a new feature to enable partial certificate chain validation for TLS listeners [#10553](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10553).

  For details, please check out the `listener.ssl.external.partial_chain` in the `listeners.conf` config file.

- Added a new feature to enable client certificate extended key usage validation for TLS listeners [#10669](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10669).

  For details, please check out the `listener.ssl.external.verify_peer_ext_key_usage` in the `listeners.conf` config file.

- Added the `live_connections` field in the HTTP API `/api/v4/nodes` response [#10859](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10859).

  Previously, this interface had a `connections` field, which represented the number of active connections on the current node that had not expired. This means that even if the MQTT connection has been disconnected, as long as the client has a persistent session, it would still be counted in the `connections` field. The newly added `live_connections` field specifically counts the number of clients with MQTT connections that have not been disconnected.

- Added 3 random SQL functions to the rule engine [#11113](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11113).

  - random(): Generates a random number between 0 and 1 (0.0 =< X < 1.0).
  - uuid_v4(): Generates a random UUID (version 4) string.
  - uuid_v4_no_hyphen(): Generates a random UUID (version 4) string without hyphens.

- Added numerical range validation (23-65535) for the `mqtt.max_clientid_len` configuration parameter [#11096](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11096).

- Added a plugin `emqx_gcp_device`.

  It simplifies migration from Google IoT Core:
  - It allows import of Google IoT Core device configuration and authentication data.
  - Implements Google IoT Core compatible MQTT authentication.
  - Provides API endpoints for managing device configuration and authentication data.

- Added support for creating RabbitMQ actions with dynamic Routing Key.

  The "RabbitMQ Routing Key" parameter of RabbitMQ actions can now use dynamic variables in the `${key}` format.

- Added default ports for DynamoDB resources.

  Previously, the "DynamoDB Server" parameter of DynamoDB resources required a URL with a specified port number, otherwise the resource creation would fail.
  Now, if the URL does not include a port number, the default value will be 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS).

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where the rule engine was unable to access variables exported by `FOREACH` in the `DO` clause [#10620](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10620).

  Given a payload: `{"date": "2023-05-06", "array": ["a"]}`, as well as the following SQL statement:

  ```
  FOREACH payload.date as date, payload.array as elem
  DO date, elem
  FROM "t/#"
  ```

  Prior to the fix, the `date` variable exported by `FOREACH` could not be accessed in the `DO` clause of the above SQL, resulting in the following output for the SQL statement:
  `[{"elem": "a","date": "undefined"}]`.
  After the fix, the output of the SQL statement is: `[{"elem": "a","date": "2023-05-06"}]`

- Fixed the issue where the cache of rules failed to update in certain cases [#11072](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11072).

  Prior to the fix, after manually updating the rules, there could be instances where the cache update did not synchronize to certain nodes. This would result in inconsistent rule execution states across different nodes.

- Fixed an issue where the WebHook plugin failed to execute the `on_client_connack` hook [#10710](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10710).

  See <https://github.com/emqx/emqx/issues/10628> for more details.

- Fixed an issue related to reconnection of the authentication module.

  When starting EMQX, if the connection between the authentication module and the database is disconnected, the authentication module will periodically initiate reconnection.
  Prior to the fix, even if the module was manually disabled, EMQX would still periodically reconnect to the database. After the fix, reconnection attempts are made only when the module is enabled.

- Fixed an issue where the PgSQL authentication module lost Prepared Statements after reconnection.

  Prior to the fix, if the connection between the PgSQL authentication module and the database was disconnected and reconnected, authentication would fail due to the loss of Prepared Statements, and the following error log would be printed:

  ```
  2023-03-30T20:50:48.088416+08:00 [error] abc@124.79.220.151:58561 [Postgres] query '"auth_query"' failed: {error,error,<<"26000">>,invalid_sql_statement_name,<<"prepared statement \"auth_query\" does not exist">>,[...]}
  ```

- Fixed an issue where connection to Kafka failed after importing resources from version 4.4.9.

  Prior to the fix, when importing data from version 4.4.9 to 4.4.18, if the Kafka resource was not configured with a username and password (i.e. authentication mode was NONE), EMQX might incorrectly use PLAIN authentication mode to connect to Kafka after importing, resulting in authentication failure.

- Fixed the issue of EMQX docker container unable to integrate with Kafka using Kerberos authentication.

  Prior to the fix, the EMQX docker (alpine) image was missing two software packages, libsasl and cyrus-sasl-gssapiv2, which caused the Kerberos functionality to not work properly. The error log was as follows:

  ```
  2023-06-15T05:30:31.148811+00:00 [warning] ...,{connect_kafka_server_fail,[{<<"kafka-a:9092">>,{{not_loaded,[{module,sasl_auth},{line,212},{on_load_error_info,{error,{load_failed,"Failed to load NIF library: 'Error loading shared library libsasl2.so.3: No such file or directory (needed by /opt/emqx/lib/sasl_auth-2.0.1/priv/sasl_auth.so)'"}
  ```

- Fixed the data distribution logic of the RocketMQ action in the rule engine.

  Prior to the fix, in the scenario where EMQX sends data to a RocketMQ cluster in master-slave mode, if the RocketMQ cluster has multiple master nodes, regardless of whether the `roundrobin` or `key_dispatch` strategy is used, the messages will always be distributed to the first RocketMQ master node.

- Fixed the issue of module order changing after restarting or joining a cluster.

  Prior to the fix, after a node restarting or joining a cluster, the order of modules could change, which would cause the authentication chain order to change if multiple authentication modules were enabled.

- Fixed the issue of failing to import listener configurations from 4.4.7.

  Prior to the fix, if the JSON file contained configurations for "wss" or "wss" listeners, the import could fail due to an incompatible type of the `fail_if_no_subprotocol` configuration item, but without any error messages or logs.

- Fixed the issue of hot configurations not taking effect after a new node joins the cluster.

  Prior to the fix, when a node joined a cluster with hot configurations enabled, it could successfully replicate the hot configurations from the cluster, but the configurations did not take effect at runtime.

- Fix the issue that the WebSocket downlink message type of the OCPP gateway is incorrect.

  Prior to the fix, the WebSocket downlink message type of the OCPP gateway was `binary`, but it should be `text`.

- Fix issue when MQTT clients could not connect over TLS if the listener was configured to use TLS v1.3 only.

  The problem was that TLS connection was trying to use options incompatible with TLS v1.3.

- Fixed the issue of retainer module throwing errors after hot upgrade.

  After upgrading from old versions (e4.4.0 ~ e4.4.16) to e4.4.17 or e4.4.18, the retainer module might throw errors, causing retain messages to be unable to be sent properly. The error log is as follows:

  ```
  2023-05-17T01:48:44.515012+00:00 [error] mqtt_conti@62.93.210.184:54851 [Hooks] Failed to execute {fun emqx_retainer:on_session_subscribed/3,[]}: {error,badarg,[...]}
  ```

- Fixed the issue of error log appearing when testing the connectivity of RabbitMQ.

  Prior to the fix, when clicking the test button for RabbitMQ resources, the following error log would be printed (only the error log appeared, and the functionality was not affected):

  ```
  2023-06-02T05:59:16.025229+00:00 [error] Destroy Resource bridge_rabbit failed, ResId: <<"_probe_:6edc3a76">>, not_found
  ```

- Fixed the issue of creating multiple duplicate hot configuration modules when continuously clicking the **Enable** button on the Dashboard settings page.

## 4.4.18

*Release Date: 2023-04-28*

### Enhancements

- Added plugin `emqx_ocpp` to support the OCPP 1.6-J protocol.

    OCPP (Open Charge Point Protocol) is a protocol used for
    communication between electric vehicle charging stations and central
    management systems. This plugin serves as an OCPP gateway for EMQX,
    enabling seamless integration between OCPP and MQTT protocols. It
    facilitates the smooth connection of charging stations to EMQX
    through OCPP over WebSocket.".

    To start the plugin, you can use the
    `emqx_ctl plugins load emqx_ocpp` command or EMQX Dashboard.
    Additionally, tools such as
    [ocpp-go](https://github.com/lorenzodonini/ocpp-go) can be used to
    simulate charging points for message exchange testing.

- Improved the placeholder syntax of rule engine.

    The parameters of actions support using placeholder syntax to
    dynamically fill in the content of strings. The format of the
    placeholder syntax is `${key}`.\
    Before this improvement, the `key` in `${key}` could only contain
    letters, numbers, and underscores. Now the `key` supports any UTF8
    characters.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where required plugins were missing in
    `data/load_plugins`.

    Before this fix, if the `data/load_plugins` file was manually
    deleted and EMQX was restarted, three required plugins
    (`emqx_schema_registry`, `emqx_eviction_agent`,
    `emqx_node_rebalance`) would not be automatically enabled and would
    not be recorded in the newly generated `data/load_plugins` file.

## 4.4.17

*Release Date: 2023-04-13*

### Enhancements

- When the listener enabled with `Proxy Protocol` receives a TCP port probe, no error logs will be printed anymore [emqx/esockd#172](https://github.com/emqx/esockd/pull/172).

  Before the fix, if the listener had enabled the proxy protocol (`listener.tcp.external.proxy_protocol=on`), but the connection was disconnected after the TCP handshake was completed and before the proxy information was received, the following error log would be printed:

  ```
  [error] supervisor: 'esockd_connection_sup - <0.3265.0>', errorContext: connection_shutdown, reason: {recv_proxy_info_error,tcp_closed}, offender:
  ```

  After the fix, no logs will be printed, but you can still view the error reason statistics through the `emqx_ctl listeners` command.

- Improved the error logs of the listener for file descriptor exhaustion [emqx/esockd#173](https://github.com/emqx/esockd/pull/173).

  Before the improvement, the log was:

  ```
  [error] Accept error on 0.0.0.0:1883: emfile
  ```

  After the improvement, the log became:

  ```
  [error] Accept error on 0.0.0.0:1883: EMFILE (Too many open files)
  ```

- Improved the performance of the rule engine when there are many rules [#10283](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10283)

  Before the improvement, when there were many rules, the rule engine would consume a lot of CPU time on rule queries and matching, becoming a performance bottleneck.
  In this optimization, by simply adding a cache to the rule list, the rule execution efficiency in this scenario was greatly improved.
  In our test, we created 700 rules that did not perform any actions (bound to the "do_nothing" debugging action) on a 32-core 32G virtual machine, and sent MQTT messages to EMQX at a rate of 1000 messages per second (that is, the rule trigger frequency was 700 * 1000 times per second).
  In the above scenario, the CPU usage of the optimized rule engine dropped to 55% ~ 60% of the previous level.

- Improve the alarm logs when importing data from old versions (4.2 or earlier).

  Before this change, if data was imported from versions 4.2 or earlier to version 4.4, the built-in authentication part of the data would be discarded due to the lack of authentication type, and the log description of the failure reason was not clear enough.
  After this change, the importing will fail, and the EMQX log will prompt the user to use the command line tool for data import and specify the authentication type:

  ```
  emqx_ctl data import <filename> --env '{"auth.mnesia.as":"username"}'
  ```

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where `Erlang distribution` could not use TLS [#9981](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9981).

  For more information on `Erlang distribution`, see [here](https://www.emqx.io/docs/en/v4.4/advanced/cluster.html).

- Fixed the issue where MQTT bridging could not verify TLS certificates with wildcard domains on the peer side [#10094](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10094).

- Fixed the issue where EMQX could not timely clear the information of disconnected MQTT connections when there were too many messages backlogged in the retainer. [#10189](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10189).

  Before the fix, the `emqx_retainer` plugin and the EMQX connection information cleanup task shared a process pool. Therefore, if the process pool was blocked by a large number of retain message distribution tasks, many disconnected MQTT connection information would not be cleared in time. See [#9409](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/issues/9409) for details.
  After the fix, the `emqx_retainer` plugin uses a separate process pool to avoid this problem.

- Fixed the issue where the path of the template file `service-monitor.yaml` in the Helm Chart was incorrect. [#10229](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10229)

- When upgrading from EMQX 4.3 to 4.4, EMQX will migrate the ACL table in the "built-in authentication" module upon restart.

  Before the fix, if data was migrated from version 4.3 to 4.4 by copying the `data/mnesia/<node-name>` directory, after the migration was completed,
  when viewing the "built-in authentication" module through the Dashboard, a 500 error would occur because the ACL table was not migrated to the new format.
  Note: This issue only occurs when the module is disabled, and users can manually enable the module to resolve it.
  After the fix, EMQX will attempt to migrate the ACL table upon restart after upgrading, thus avoiding this issue.

- Fix the issue of incorrect counting statistics for the IoTDB action.

  Before the fix, if all measurements were null, IoTDB would ignore them, not insert any data but return 200 OK, causing the increment of the successful sending count to be incorrect.
  After the fix, when all measurements are null, the IoTDB action will discard the request and count it as a sending failure.

- Fix the issue of rule creation failure when TDEngine SQL statements contain line breaks.

  Before the fix, TDEngine SQL statements could not contain line breaks. For example, when using the following statement as the `SQL template` parameter for the TDEngine action, rule creation would fail:

  ```
  INSERT INTO ${devid}
  USING
    tsdb.profit
  TAGS
    ('${custid}', '${devid}')
  VALUES (${ts}, ${value})
  ```

- Fix the issue of incorrect encoding of error messages returned by the HTTP API `/load_rebalance/:node/start`.

- Fix the process leak issue of the RocketMQ client in EMQX [rocketmq-client-erl#24](https://github.com/emqx/rocketmq-client-erl/pull/24).

  EMQX's RocketMQ client periodically obtains node information from RocketMQ, checks whether the node information has been updated, and updates or adds producer processes based on the returned results.
  Before the fix, due to problems with the method of comparing node information, process leaks could occur in certain situations.

## 4.4.16

*Release Date: 2023-03-10*

This version update includes 4 enhancements and 7 fixes.

### Enhancements

- Improve the logs for IoTDB resource.
  Before this change, if the user configured a different `iotdb_version` from the installed IoTDB
  version, sending messages to IoTDB will fail but it is hard to know the reason just from the log
  messages.
  After this change, we will print more readable logs to prompt the user that he may have
  configured a wrong `iotdb_version`.

- Don't print error logs when the offline-msg actions receive QoS0 messages.

- Change "EMQX" to "EMQX" from the outputs of CLIs and names of plugins.

### Bug Fixes

- Start the `emqx_schema_registry` plugin automatically when release hot upgrade.
  The `emqx_schema_registry` is a necessary plugin when using rules to decode serialized binary data
  (e.g. Protobuf or Avro), we should ensure this plugin started in the EMQX enterprise.

- Fix the issue that the `message_key` parameter of the RocketMQ action does not work.

- Fix the rule failed when processing the decoded protobuf messages.
  Before this fix, if the protobuf schema contains `oneof` definitions, the rule may failed when trying to parse the decoded message to JSON string.

- Fix the issue that send JSON Object as Kafka Headers failed.

- Delete the temporary directories generated by resources and `emqx-modules`.
  Before this fix, sometimes the sub-directories in `data/rules` and `data/modules` cannot be cleaned even after the resources or `emqx-module` are deleted.

- Fix some problems in the descriptions of HStreamDB resource fields.

- Avoid changing the payload of MQTT messages when printing debug logs [#10091](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10091).
  Before this fix, if EMQX receives a message with Payload "e\ne\nc\nc\n2\n\n\n", the log message will be as follows:

  ```
  2023-03-08T13:28:04.320622+08:00 [debug] mqttx_e34bd582@127.0.0.1:54020 [MQTT] RECV PUBLISH(Q1, R0, D0, Topic=t/1, PacketId=39467, Payload=e, e, c, c, 2, , , )
  ```

  This is the corresponding log message now:

  ```
  2023-03-08T14:26:50.935575+08:00 [debug] mqttx_e34bd582@127.0.0.1:54020 [MQTT] RECV PUBLISH(Q1, R0, D0, Topic=t/1, PacketId=39467, Payload=<<"e\ne\nc\nc\n2\n\n\n">>)
  ```

## 4.4.15

*Release Date: 2023-03-03*

This version update includes 16 enhancements and 20 fixes.
Among the enhancements, there are new exciting new features worth highlighting:

- Upgrade the MongoDB client library of EMQX to support MongoDB 5.1 and above.
- Dashboard supports the proxy protocol of HAProxy.
- Release the Ubuntu 22.04 installation package.
- Support Kafka headers in rule engine.
- Support storing data to IoTDB using rule-engine.

### Enhancements

- Support Kafka headers in rule engine.

- Support storing data to IoTDB using rule-engine.

- The JT/T 808 compatible non-standard location reporting messages. When a user uses a reserved ID to report a location, EMQX will pass it through in Base64 format instead of disconnecting the client.

- Only create EMQX modules locally when the emqx_modules application is started.
  Before this change, we RPC to all the nodes to create/recreate modules when emqx_modules application
  get started, so finally we created modules N^2 times on all the nodes (N times on each node).

- Improve the log message when the DynamoDB action cannot find the `hash_key` or `range_key`.

- HStreamDB driver update to support HStreamDB ~> 0.12.0.

- The plugin `schema_registry` will be enabled by default as an optional feature of `rule_engine`.

- Add TLS connections support for HStreamDB action.

- The MongoDB library has been upgraded to support MongoDB version 5.1 and greater.

- Support proxy protocol of HAProxy for dashboard API [9803](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9803).

- Added Ubuntu 22.04 package release [#9831](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9831).

- Improve the integration of the `banned` and the `delayed` feature [#9790](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9790).
  Now when publishing a delayed message will check first if its source client is banned, if true, this publish will be ignored.

- Security enhancement for retained messages [#9790](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9790).
  The retained messages will not be published if the publisher client is banned.

- Now the corresponding session will be kicked when client is banned by `clientid` [#9904](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9904).

- Add more debug logs for authentication and ACL [#9943](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9943).

- Expose the stats `live_connections.count` and `live_connections.max` to Prometheus [#9929](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9929).

### Bug Fixes

- Fix there's no error logs when query the JWKS server failed [#9931](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9931).

- The returned client lists of HTTP query `GET /api/v4/clients?_page=2&_limit=20` to different nodes might be inconsistent [#9926](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9926).

- Fix the problem that new MQTT TLS connections failed to establish after release hot upgrade [#9810](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9810).
  For more detailed information please see: [emqx/esockd#170](https://github.com/emqx/esockd/pull/170).

- Fix a problem in the log message format of MQTT packets [#9858](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9858).
  Before this fix, a comma was missing between the flags (DUP) of the fixed header
  and the fields (ClientId) of the variable header:

  ```
  2023-01-29T13:40:36.567692+08:00 [debug] 127.0.0.1:50393 [MQTT] RECV CONNECT(Q0, R0, D0ClientId=test_client, ... Password=undefined)

## 4.4.14

*Release Date: 2023-01-06*

### Enhancements

- Add a password complexity requirement when adding or modifying Dashboard users via the API. Now passwords must contain at least 2 of alphabetic, numeric and special characters, and must be 8 to 64 characters long.

### Bug Fixes

- Fix the problem that adding or importing Dashboard users via the API fails to add complex passwords due to incorrect checksum of the passwords.

- Fix load bootstrap_app_file's apps is not sync when reboot.

## 4.4.13

*Release Date: 2023-01-03*

### Bug Fixes

- Fix an issue where testing the GCP PubSub could leak memory, and an issue where its JWT token would fail to refresh a second time. [#9640](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9640)

## 4.4.12

*Release Date: 2022-12-29*

This version comes with an exciting new feature: cluster load rebalance.
The newly introduced CLI command emqx_ctl rebalance provides support of the below two common scenarios:

- Newly joined or restarted nodes may stay under-loaded for along time if the clients are mostly long-lived connections
- For maintenance, shutting down a node will cause all connected connections to reconnect around the same time, increasing the chance to overload the cluster. Also the non-clean sessions in this node will be lost.

Now it’s possible to issue the rebalance command to move some of the connections the under-loaded nodes. With the --evacuation option, we can also move all the connected MQTT clients off the node before stopping the service.

### Enhancements

- Added topic validation for `emqx_mod_rewrite`. The dest topics contains wildcards are not allowed to publish.

- TDEngine resource support HTTP response formats of both TDEngine 2.x and 3.x [emqx/tdengine-client-erl#7](https://github.com/emqx/tdengine-client-erl/pull/7).
  The HTTP response of TDEngine 2.x uses the `status` field to represent the success or failure,
  while TDEngine 3.x uses the `code` field instead.

- Support batch sending messages to [TDEngine SubTables](https://docs.tdengine.com/2.6/concept/#subtable).

- The offline message clickhouse action prints an info level log: `Destroyed .. Successfully` when enabling a rule.

- Now the rules can be created even though the corresponding resources are not ready.
  Before this change, one cannot create rules without getting the resources connected. We made it
  possible in this change, but the newly created rule will be in `disabled` state.

- Avoid delete offline message twice.
  EMQX while delete offline message in external database when subscriber send a PUBACK or PUBREC packet.
  But a message with `retain = true` will be stored twice (in retainer and external database) in case retain message and offline message are used in same time.
  The reduplicated PUBACK and PUBREC will trigger deleted action twice. And the action-metrics will also increase caused by Rule-SQL execution succeed.
  In most cases this does not generate any exceptions or errors, and only a few databases will report that the message to be deleted does not exist on the second delete.
  This change will avoid redundant offline message deletion operations.

- Users can define the `externalTrafficPolicy` of service in EMQX Enterprise Helm Chart.

- When dashboard creates a new user, the password format is `^[A-Za-z0-9]+[A-Za-z0-9-_]*$`.

### Bug Fixes

- After a reconnect, the unacknowledged QoS1/QoS2 messages in non-clean session were not retransmitted periodically as before the reconnect.
  The configuration `zone.<zone-name>.retry_interval` specifies the retransmission interval of
  unacknowledged QoS1/QoS2 messages (defaults to 30s).
  Prior to this fix, unacknowledged messages buffered in the session are re-sent only once after session take-over, but not retried at configured interval.

- The expired 'awaiting_rel' queue is not cleared after persistent session MQTT client disconnected.
  Before this change, if the 'awaiting_rel' queue is full when the MQTT client reconnect
  to the broker and publish a QoS2 message, the client will get disconnected by the broker
  with reason code RC_RECEIVE_MAXIMUM_EXCEEDED(0x93), even if the packet IDs in the 'awaiting_rel'
  queue have already expired.

- Authentication for RocketMQ resource not working.
  In this change we moved the configuration fields `access_key`, `secret_key`
  and `security_token` from the `data_to_rocket` action to the `bridge_rocket`
  resource. And we also added a new field `namespace` for RocketMQ services in
  Aliyun cloud.

- Added validation for Kafka action parameters, Segment Bytes should not be greater than Max Bytes.

- Added validation for Pulsar action parameters, Segment Bytes should not be greater than Max Bytes.

- Fix the "ORA-01000: maximum open cursors exceeded" problem when sending data via the emqx oracle resource.

- Fixed EMQX Enterprise Helm Chart deployment error.
  - Fixed the `Discovery error: no such service` error occurred during helm chart deployment, resulting in an abnormal discovery of cluster nodes.
  - Fixed EMQX Enterprise Helm Chart can not set JSON type value for EMQX Enterprise configuration items.

- Fixed an issue where the configuration would not be reloaded on all nodes in a cluster after importing a backup configuration.

- Fixed an issue where the HTTP API would fail to download a backup configuration file when downloading it from a node where it does not reside in.

- Add the `SNI` field for SSL connection configuration of Kafka resource.

- Fixed the issue that the MongoDB resource connection process was slow when authentication was enabled.

- Fixed the issue that after the release hot upgrade, EMQX occasionally alarms resources down, and the alarms could not be automatically cleared.

- Fix connection statistics in the dashboard: mark evacuated clients as disconnected before they can reconnect.

## 4.4.11

*Release Date: 2022-11-26*

This release included 23 enhancements and 21 bug fixes.
Among the enhancements, there are new exciting new features worth highlighting.

- Google PubSub integration as a Rule-Engine data bridge.
- OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) Stapling.
- CRL (Certificate Revocation List) cache.
- Pulsar data bridge supports data buffering.
- OTP upgrade from 24.1.5-3 to 24.3.4.2-1.
- Customizable client aliases to make it easier to when creating customized authentication and authorization.

It is possible to hot-upgrade from the older version e4.4 to this version.
Please note though, in order to start making use of the new features such as OCSP Stapling, and CRL cache,
a node restart (and configuration change) is required.

### Enhancements

- Upgraded Pulsar client to 0.7.0.
  Now it's possible to buffer messages to be
  produced to Pulsar while EMQX has no connection to the Pulsar
  broker.  Such messages will be retained for a configurable amount of
  time.

  Also, credentials such as basic auth and JWT tokens used for Pulsar
  authentication will be censored out when a crash happens, thus
  avoiding secret leakage to logs.

  **Note**: if an older EMQX version is upgraded to a version
  containing this update, *and then* downgraded back to the previous
  old version, there's a risk that some messages that were sent in a
  sync manner might be sent but regarded as a timeout error, which in
  turn causes such clients to be disconnected.

- Added hot-configuration support for OCSP stapling and CRL checking/caching.

- Added a new rule engine bridge and corresponding rule action for GCP PubSub.

- Support to use placeholders like `${var}` in the `Collection` field of Rule-Engine's MongoDB actions

- Add a format check to the `host` field of the InfluxDB resource in Rule-Engine.
  The host field should be an ip/domain without scheme and port.

- OTP upgrade from 24.1.5-3 to 24.3.4.2-1 [#9265](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9265).
  Change highlights:
  - Erlang/OTP [SSL library vulnerability fix](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-37026)
  - Added support for OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) Stapling
  - Added CRL (Certificate Revocation List) cache auto refresh

- Added support for OCSP stapling and CRL
  caching [#9297](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9297).

- Added support for specifying custom modules for adding clientid and common name
  aliases [#9297](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9297).
  Now you can implement a simple callback to enrich clients with aliases, and then use the aliases
  in the authentication and authorization (ACL) rules' place holders (`%cida` for clientid alias
  and `%cna` for username alias).

- Added support for specifying custom modules for custom authentication [#9297](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9297).
  To support simple authentication rules, it is no longer necessary to implement a full-blown plugin.

- Added a JWT management for Rule-Engine, for creating and refreshing JWT tokens in rule engine actions [#9241](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9241).
  This feature is so far only used in EMQX Enterprise Google PubSub integration.
  Can be used as webhook integration's JWT authentication against the webhook service endpoint.

- Make sure listener's `tls_versions` config value is one or more of `tlsv1`, `tlsv1.1`, `tlsv1.2`, `tlsv1.3` [#9260](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9260).

- Remove useless information from the dashboard listener failure log [#9260](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9260).

- We now trigger the `'message.acked'` hook after the CoAP gateway sends a message to the device and receives the ACK from the device [#9264](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9264).
  With this change, the CoAP gateway can be combined with the offline message caching function (in the
  emqx enterprise), so that CoAP devices are able to read the missed messages from the database when
  it is online again.

- Support to use placeholders like `${var}` in the HTTP `Headers` of Rule-Engine's Webhook actions [#9239](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9239).

- Asynchronously refresh the resources and rules during emqx boot-up [#9199](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9199).
  This is to avoid slowing down the boot if some resources spend long time establishing the connection.

- Add a warning log if the ACL check failed for subscription [#9124](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9124).
  This is to make the ACL deny logging for subscription behave the same as for publish.

- JWT ACL claim supports `all` action to imply the rules applie to both `pub` and `sub` [#9044](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9044).

- Added a log censor to avoid logging sensitive data [#9189](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9189).
  If the data to be logged is a map or key-value list which contains sensitive key words such as `password`, the value is obfuscated as `******`.

- Enhanced log security in ACL modules, sensitive data will be obscured [#9242](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9242).

- Add `management.bootstrap_apps_file` configuration to bulk import default app/secret when EMQX initializes the database [#9273](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9273).

- Added two new configs for deterministic order of authentication and ACL checks [#9283](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9283).
  The two new global config names are `auth_order` and `acl_order`.
  When multiple ACL or auth plugins (or modules) are enabled, without this config, the order (in which each backend is queried)
  is determined by the start/restart order of the plugin (or module).
  Meaning, if a plugin (or module) is restarted after initial boot, it may get ordered to the end of the list.
  With this config, you may set the order with a comma-speapated ACL or auth plugin names (or aliases).
  For example: `acl_order = jwt,http`, this will make sure `jwt` is always checked before `http`,
  meaning if JWT is not found (or no `acl` cliam) for a client, then the ACL check will fallback to use the HTTP backend.

- Added configurations to enable more `client.disconnected` events (and counter bumps) [#9267](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9267).
  Prior to this change, the `client.disconnected` event (and counter bump) is triggered when a client
  performs a 'normal' disconnect, or is 'kicked' by system admin, but NOT triggered when a
  stale connection had to be 'discarded' (for clean session) or 'takeovered' (for non-clean session) by new connection.
  Now it is possible to set configs `broker.client_disconnect_discarded` and `broker.client_disconnect_takeovered` to `on` to enable the event in these scenarios.

- For Rule-Engine resource creation failure, delay before the first retry [#9313](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9313).
  Prior to this change, the retry delay was added *after* the retry failure.

### Bug Fixes

- Fix the default authentication mechanism of Kafka resource changed to `NONE` from `PLAIN`
  when upgrading emqx from e4.4.5 and older versions.

- Fix an upgrade issue for JWT authentication plugin.
  When upgrading from e4.4.3 or earlier, an EMQX internal resource which holds the keys will have to be restarted,
  during the restart, clients may fail to be authenticated.

- Fixed the option to choose the `reset_by_subscriber` offset reset
  policy in Kafka Consumer.

- Added the missing `tlsv1.3` option to `tls_versions` in hot-config.

- Made Rule-Engine able to connect SQL server when its listening port is not the default (`1433`).

- Make sure Schema-Registry API supports Percent-encoding `name` in HTTP request URI.
  Note that the `name` in `POST /api/v4/schemas` request body should not be percent-encoded as it's a JSON field value.

- Fix an upgrade issue for JWT authentication plugin.
  When upgrading from e4.3.9 or earlier, an EMQX internal resource which holds the keys will have to be restarted,
  during the restart, clients may fail to be authenticated.

- Fix get trace list crash when trace not initialize. [#9156](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9156)

- Fix create trace sometime failed by end_at time has already passed. [#9156](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9156)

- Fix that after uploading a backup file with an non-ASCII filename, HTTP API `GET /data/export` fails with status code 500 [#9224](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9224).

- Improve the display of rule's 'Maximum Speed' counter to only reserve 2 decimal places [#9185](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9185).
  This is to avoid displaying floats like `0.30000000000000004` on the dashboard.

- Fix the issue that emqx prints too many error logs when connecting to mongodb but auth failed [#9184](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9184).

- Fix that after receiving publish in `idle mode` the emqx-sn gateway may panic [#9024](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9024).

- "Pause due to rate limit" log level demoted from warning to notice [#9134](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9134).

- Restore old `emqx_auth_jwt` module API, so the hook callback functions registered in older version will not be invalidated after hot-upgrade [#9144](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9144).

- Fixed the response status code for the `/status` endpoint [#9210](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9210).
  Before the fix, it always returned `200` even if the EMQX application was not running.  Now it returns `503` in that case.

- Fix message delivery related event encoding [#9226](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9226)
  For Rule-Engine's input events like `$events/message_delivered`, and `$events/message_dropped`,
  if the message was delivered to a shared-subscription, the encoding (to JSON) of the event will fail.
  Affected versions: `v4.3.21`, `v4.4.10`, `e4.3.16` and `e4.4.10`.

- Make sure Rule-Engine API supports Percent-encoding `rule_id` and `resource_id` in HTTP request path [#9190](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9190).
  Note that the `id` in `POST /api/v4/rules` should be literals (not encoded) when creating a `rule` or `resource`.
  See docs [Create Rule](https://docs.emqx.com/en/enterprise/v4.4/advanced/http-api.html#post-api-v4-rules) [Create Resource](https://docs.emqx.com/en/enterprise/v4.4/advanced/http-api.html#post-api-v4-resources).

- Calling 'DELETE /alarms/deactivated' now deletes deactived alarms on all nodes, including remote nodes, not just the local node [#9280](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9280).

- When republishing messages or bridge messages to other brokers, check the validity of the topic and make sure it does not have topic wildcards [#9291](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9291).

- Disable authorization for `api/v4/emqx_prometheus` endpoint on management api listener (default 8081) [#9294](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9294).

## 4.4.10

*Release Date: 2022-10-14*

### Enhancements

- Added more Kafka action parameter checks
  - TCP send buffer size and max batch size parameters are not allowed to be left blank from the configration UI.
  - The combination of "Produce Strategy" set to 'key_dispatch' and the "Key" set to "none" is now not allowed,
    the dashboard will get an error with text like: "with strategy set to 'key_dispatch', key is not allowed to be 'none'"

- TLS listener memory usage optimization [#9005](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9005).
  New config `listener.ssl.$NAME.hibernate_after` to hibernate TLS connection process after idling.
  Hibernation can reduce RAM usage significantly, but may cost more CPU.
  This configuration is by default disabled.
  Our preliminary test shows a 50% of RAM usage decline when configured to '5s'.

- TLS listener default buffer size to 4KB [#9007](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9007).
  Eliminate uncertainty that the buffer size is set by OS default.

- Disable authorization for `api/v4/emqx_prometheus` endpoint [#8955](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8955).

- Added a test to prevent a last will testament message to be
  published when a client is denied connection [#8894](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8894).

- More rigorous checking of flapping to improve stability of the system [#9045](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9045).
  Previsouly only normal disconnects are counted, now the connection rejections (e.g. authentication failure) is also included.
  Find more about flapping detection in [EMQX document](https://www.emqx.io/docs/en/v4.3/configuration/configuration.html#flapping-detect-policy)

- QoS1 and QoS2 messages in session's buffer are re-dispatched to other members in the group
  when the session terminates [#9094](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9094).
  to prevent sessions from buffering messages, however this acknowledgement costs extra resources.

- Fix delayed publish timing inaccuracy caused by OS time change [#8908](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8908).

### Bug Fixes

- Fix `load_modules` reset after new node joins the cluster.
  Prior to this fix, if `load_modules` for a cluster has been changed, adding a new node to the cluster with default modules
  would cause the other nodes to reset to default too.
  In this fix, the node which is going to join the cluster will copy the `loaded_modules` from the oldest node in the cluster.

- Fix getting subscriptions from backends successfully with QoS values out of range [0, 2].
  Before this change, when we add subscriptions for clients from backends like Redis or MySQL, we won't validate the QoS.
  For example if the QoS is an integer -1, the topic was still subscribed successfully with QoS -1,
  if we send a message to this topic, then an error will occur and the MQTT connection will crash.
  After this change QoS will be clamped into range [0, 2].

- Fix Rule-Engine increased 'success' counter when get subscriptions from Redis failed (due to query Redis timeout).

- Fix Rule-Engine increased 'success' counter when saving offline messages with QoS = 0.
  We don't allow saving offline messages to backends with QoS = 0, so we need to increase the 'failed' counter instead of the 'success' counter in this case.

- Fix the `verify` field is missing from the SSL settings of redis-cluster and redis-sentinel resources.

- Fixed Redis resource liveness problem issue. Prior to this fix, the resource is considered alive when connection can be established.
  The fix is to perform a PING query to make sure the service is alive.

- Fix the redis-cluster resource prints too many error logs when redis servers are not avaliable.

- Fixed an internal Redis resource ID clashing. This clashing may cause resources in use getting deleted when deleting another resource.

- Mask secret/password in the resource/module creation UI.

- Fix HTTP client library to handle SSL socket passive signal [#9145](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9145).

- Hide redis password in error logs [#9071](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9071).
  More changes in redis client included in this release:
  - Improve redis connection error logging [eredis#19](https://github.com/emqx/eredis/pull/19).
    Also added support for eredis to accept an anonymous function as password instead of
    passing around plaintext args which may get dumpped to crash logs (hard to predict where).
    This change also added `format_status` callback for `gen_server` states which hold plaintext
    password so the process termination log and `sys:get_status` will print '******' instead of
    the password to console.
  - Avoid pool name clashing [eredis_cluster#22](https://github.com/emqx/eredis_cluster/pull/22).
    Same `format_status` callback is added here too for `gen_server`s which hold password in
    their state.

- Fix shared subscription message re-dispatches [#9094](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9094).
  - When discarding QoS 2 inflight messages, there were excessive logs
  - For wildcard deliveries, the re-dispatch used the wrong topic (the publishing topic,
    but not the subscribing topic), caused messages to be lost when dispatching.

- Fix shared subscription group member unsubscribe issue when 'sticky' strategy is used.
  Prior to this fix, if a previously picked member unsubscribes from the group (without reconnect)
  the message is still dispatched to it.
  This issue only occurs when unsubscribe with the session kept.
  Fixed in [#9119](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9119)

- Fix shared subscription 'sticky' strategy when there is no local subscriptions at all.
  Prior to this change, it may take a few rounds to randomly pick group members until a local subscriber
  is hit (and then start sticking to it).
  After this fix, it will start sticking to whichever randomly picked member even when it is a
  subscriber from another node in the cluster.
  Fixed in [#9122](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9122)

- Fix rule engine fallback actions metrics reset [#9125](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9125).

## 4.4.1

*Release Date: 2022-02-18*

NOTE: 4.4.1 is in sync with: 4.3.7.
The compare base of this change set is 4.4.0.

### Important changes

- A cluster-wide total connections calculation bug was fixed in in Enterprise edition 4.4.1. Previously only the individual node's local number of connections were checked against the max number of connections allowed by the license. After this fix, the total number of connections is aggregated cluster-wide every 5 seconds. An extra 10% overrun is allowed to compensate the delays in aggregation.
- The slow subscription feature is improved. It supports counting the time spent in the process of message transmission, and recording and displaying time-consuming clients and topics.
**Users planning to upgrade should be aware of the possibility that this change may cause clients to reach the license limit and not be able to connect.**
- Rules engine supports Lindorm database
- Support client-level message drop metrics
- Optimize online Trace log display on Dashboard, support syntax highlighting

### Minor changes

- Support alarm about the usage rate of license connections. By default, the number of connections reaches 80% of the allowed number of licenses, and the alarm is raised. When it is less than 75%, the alarm is cleared. User can also customize in `emqx.conf`: `license.connection_high_watermark_alarm` , `license.connection_low_watermark_alarm`
- Support alarm about license expiration, when the validity period is less than 30 days, the alarm will be raised
- Rule engine supports the configuration of rules and actions for the event of abnormal loss of client messages to enhance the user's custom processing capabilities in this scenario
- Improve the relevant metrics during the execution of the rule engine SQL matching
- Fuzzy search on client supports special characters such as `*`, `(`, `)`
- Improve ACL-related metrics to solve the issue that the count does not increase due to hitting the ACL cache
- Added `connected_at` field to webhook event notifications
- Log client state before terminating client due to holding the lock too long

### Bug Fixes

- Fix the issue that data import and export were not available in some cases
- The module update mechanism is improved to solve the issue that the module is unavailable after the update fails
- Fix the issue that the rule engine did not perform type checking when executing the size comparison statement
- Fix the issue that the related counts are cleared after updating the rule engine action
- Fixed the issue that the metrics interface does not return authentication metrics such as `client.acl.deny` by default
- Fixed the issue that the subscription query interface did not return paginated data
- Fix the issue of parsing failure when STOMP handles TCP sticky packets
- Fix the issue where the session creation time option was not available when filtering clients
- Fix the issue where memory alarms might not be triggered after restarting
- Fix the crash of import data when user data exists in `emqx_auth_mnesia` plugin

## 4.4.0

*Release Date: 2021-12-21*

EMQX Enterprise 4.4.0 mainly includes the following changes:

### Important changes

- Starting from 4.4, EMQX releases are named with Erlang/OTP release in the package name. e.g. `emqx-ee-4.4.0-otp24.1.5-3-centos7-arm64.rpm`

- **For Debian/Ubuntu users**, Debian/Ubuntu package (deb) installed EMQX now now run on systemd. This is to use systemd's supervision functionality to ensure that EMQX service restarts after a crash. The package installation service upgrade from init.d to systemd has been verified, but it is still recommended that you verify and confirm again before deploying to the production environment, at least to ensure that systemd is available in your system

- Rule engine InfluxDB integration adds support for InfluxDB v2 API, rule engine supports InfluxDB 2.0 and InfluxDB Cloud now

- Rule engine adds support for SAP Event Mesh

- Rule engine adds support for MatrixDB

- MongoDB integration supports DNS SRV and TXT Records resolution, which can seamlessly connect with MongoDB Altas

- Supports trace online, users can complete the tracking operation of the client and topic on the Dashboard, and view or download the trace log

- Supports slow subscription statistics, which can be used to find abnormal situations such as message blockage in the production environment in time

- Support dynamic modification of MQTT Keep Alive to adapt to different energy consumption strategies

- Support 4.3 to 4.4 rolling upgrade of clustered nodes. See upgrade document for more dtails.

- TLS for cluster backplane (RPC) connections.

### Minor changes

- Dashboard supports viewing the number of active client connections

- Dashboard supports relative paths and custom access paths

- Dashboard remove tab navigation

- Support configuring whether to write integer data to InfluxDB as floating point type

- Supports configuring whether to forward retained messages with empty payload to suit users who are still using MQTT v3.1. The relevant configurable item is `retainer.stop_publish_clear_msg`

- Multi-language hook extension (ExHook) supports dynamic cancellation of subsequent forwarding of client messages

- Rule engine SQL supports the use of single quotes in FROM clause, for example: `SELECT * FROM't/#'`

- Optimize the use and interaction of the built-in access control file module

- Change the default value of the `max_topic_levels` configurable item to 128. Previously, it had no limit (configured to 0), which may be a potential DoS threat

- Improve the error log content when the Proxy Protocol message is received but the `proxy_protocol` configuration is not turned on

- Add additional message attributes to the message reported by the gateway. Messages from gateways such as CoAP, LwM2M, Stomp, ExProto, etc., when converted to EMQX messages, add fields such as protocol name, protocol version, user name, client IP, etc., which can be used for multi-language hook extension (ExHook)

- HTTP client performance improvement

- Add openssl-1.1 to RPM dependency

### Bug Fixes

- Fix the issue that the client process becomes unresponsive due to the blockage of RPC calls between nodes

- Fix the issue that the lock management process `ekka_locker` crashes after killing the suspended lock owner

- Fix the issue of garbled data when writing data to RocketMQ asynchronously

- Fix the issue of inaccurate statistics of RocketMQ

- Fix the display error of the Dashboard monitoring page when the number of cluster nodes exceeds seven

- Fix the issue that the rule engine may have a higher failure rate when saving data to MySQL

- Fix the issue that the Clickhouse-based offline messaging feature of the rule engine is unavailable

- Fix the issue that the Max Returned Count option in the MongoDB-based offline message feature of the rule engine cannot be used

- Fix the issue that the Path parameter of WebHook action in rule engine cannot use the rule engine variable

- Fix MongoDB authentication module cannot use Replica Set mode and other issues

- Fix the issue of out-of-sequence message forwarding between clusters. The relevant configurable item is `rpc.tcp_client_num`

- Fix the issue of incorrect calculation of memory usage

- Fix MQTT bridge malfunction when remote host is unreachable (hangs the connection)

- Fix the issue that HTTP headers may be duplicated

## 4.3.19

*Release Date: 2023-03-03*

### Enhancements

- Add TCP keepalive configuration for Kafka client.

- Improve error messages in the dashboard when adding users to the internal auth database.

- The plugin `schema_registry` will be enabled by default as an optional feature of `rule_engine`.

### Bug fixes

- Fix the problem that new MQTT TLS connections failed to establish after release hot upgrade.
  For more detailed information please see: [emqx/esockd#170](https://github.com/emqx/esockd/pull/170).

- fix the issue that produce messages to RocketMQ cluster using rule-engine failed.

- fix some issues in descriptions of the actions, resources amd emqx-modules.

- fix there's no error logs when query the JWKS server failed.

- Fixed an error when forward MQTT messages with User-Property using the `republish` action.

- Fix the problem of sending offline messages to clients in reverse order when using Redis offline message feature.

- Fix the problem that the same request sent to different EMQX nodes returns inconsistent results when sending the HTTP API to get the client list in paging mode.
  Before this change, different lists of clients will be returned if one sends
  'GET <http://localhost:8081/api/v4/clients?_page=1&_limit=1000>' to different
  EMQX nodes in the cluster.

- When uploading a license, now EMQX will always reload the license, to avoid the case where a user replaces the current license file with new contents.

- Only create EMQX modules locally when the emqx_modules application is started.
  Before this change, we RPC to all the nodes to create/recreate modules when emqx_modules application
  get started, so finally we created modules N^2 times on all the nodes (N times on each node).

- Password format for new dashboard users is no longer limited to ^[A-Za-z0-9]+[A-Za-z0-9-_]*$.

- Returning a failure when creating an existing listener in a cluster using the API.

- Delete the files directory when `resources/modules/schema_registry` were deleted to avoid files leaking.

## 4.3.18

*Release Date: 2022-12-29*

### Enhancements

- Fix the "ORA-01000: maximum open cursors exceeded" problem when sending data via the emqx oracle resource [#1560](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-enterprise/pull/1560).

- Add more PSK ciphers support [#1619](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-enterprise/pull/1619).

- Upgrade Erlang/OTP from 23.3.4.9-3 to 23.3.4.18-1 [#1660](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-enterprise/pull/1660).

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where the configuration would not be reloaded on all nodes in a cluster after importing a backup configuration. [#1486](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-enterprise/pull/1486)

- Fixed an issue where the HTTP API would fail to download a backup configuration file when downloading it from a node where it does not reside in. [#1486](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-enterprise/pull/1486)

- Add validations for the config fields of Kafka resource [#1511](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-enterprise/pull/1511).
  Before this change, when creating Kafka resources, some of the config fields had no validity check, such
  as duration and byte size. Even if arbitrary strings were passed to these fields, the resource
  could be created successfully, then later leads to runtime error (until resource is updated).

- Avoid delete offline message twice [#1522](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-enterprise/pull/1522).
  EMQX while delete offline message in external database when subscriber send a PUBACK or PUBREC packet.
  But a message with `retain = true` will be stored twice (in retainer and external database) in case retain message and offline message are used in same time.
  The reduplicated PUBACK and PUBREC will trigger deleted action twice. And the action-metrics will also increase caused by Rule-SQL execution suceeeed.
  In most cases this does not generate any exceptions or errors, and only a few databases will report that the message to be deleted does not exist on the second delete.
  This change will avoid redundant offline message deletion operations.

- Upgrade http client library `ehttpc` from `0.2.1` to `0.4.2` [#1587](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-enterprise/pull/1587).

- Added topic validation for `emqx_mod_rewrite`. The dest topics contains wildcards are not allowed to publish [#1589](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-enterprise/pull/1589).

- The offline message clickhouse action prints an info level log: `Destroyed .. Successfully` when enabling a rule [#1594](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-enterprise/pull/1594).

- Now the rules can be created even though the corresponding resources are not ready [#1620](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-enterprise/pull/1620).
  Before this change, one cannot create rules without getting the resources connected. We made it
  possible in this change, but the newly created rule will be in `disabled` state.

- Fixed `cluster/invite_node` crash if node name is not provided [#1531](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-enterprise/pull/1531).

- Fixed broken error message for bad rpc in `/load_rebalance/{node}/evacuation/start` [#1572](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-enterprise/pull/1572).

- Fixed load bootstrap file when no bootstrap user in `mqtt_app` [#1600](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-enterprise/pull/1600).

- The expired 'awaiting_rel' queue is not cleared after persistent session MQTT client disconnected [#1574](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-enterprise/pull/1574).
  Before this change, if the 'awaiting_rel' queue is full when the MQTT client reconnect to the broker and publish a QoS2 message, the client will get
  disconnected by the broker with reason code RC_RECEIVE_MAXIMUM_EXCEEDED(0x93),
  even if the packet IDs in the 'awaiting_rel' queue have already expired.

- Trigger `message.dropped` hook when QoS2 message is resend by client with a same packet id, or 'awaiting_rel' queue is full [#1605](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-enterprise/pull/1605).

- After a reconnect, the unacknowledged QoS1/QoS2 messages in non-clean session were not retransmitted periodically as before the reconnect [#1617](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-enterprise/pull/1617).
  The configuration `zone.<zone-name>.retry_interval` specifies the retransmission interval of
  unacknowledged QoS1/QoS2 messages (defaults to 30s).
  Prior to this fix, unacknowledged messages buffered in the session are re-sent only once after session take-over, but not retried at configured interval.

- Fix Rule-Engine action `Data to InfluxDB` exection failed since hot-upgrade from `e4.3.0..e4.3.10` to `e4.3.11..e4.3.17` [#1601](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-enterprise/pull/1601).

- Added validation for Kafka action parameters, Segment Bytes should not be greater than Max Bytes [#1608](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-enterprise/pull/1608).

- Added validation for the duration and bytesize parameters of Pulsar actions [#1631](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-enterprise/pull/1631).

- Authentication for RocketMQ resource not working [#1561](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-enterprise/pull/1561).
  In this change we moved the configuration fields `access_key`, `secret_key`
  and `security_token` from the `data_to_rocket` action to the `bridge_rocket`
  resource. And we also added a new field `namespace` for RocketMQ services in
  Aliyun cloud.

- When dashboard creates a new user, the password length must match 3-32 and the format is `^[A-Za-z0-9]+[A-Za-z0-9-_]*$` [#1599](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-enterprise/pull/1599).

- When resource creation is too slow, there may be some temporary probing connections left [#1641](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-enterprise/pull/1641).

- Add the `SNI` field for SSL connection configuration of Kafka resource [#1647](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-enterprise/pull/1647).

- Fixed the issue that the MongoDB resource connection process was slow when authentication was enabled [#1669](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-enterprise/pull/1669).

- Fixed the issue that after the release hot upgrade, EMQX occasionally alarms resources down, and the alarms could not be automatically cleared [#1668](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-enterprise/pull/1668).

## 4.3.17

*Release Date: 2022-11-26*

### Enhancements

- Support to use placeholders like `${var}` in the `Collection` field of Rule-Engine's MongoDB actions [#1503](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-enterprise/pull/1503).

- Add a format check to the `host` field of the InfluxDB resource in Rule-Engine [#1426](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-enterprise/pull/1426).
  The host field should be an ip/domain without scheme and port.

- Make sure listener's `tls_versions` config value is one or more of `tlsv1`, `tlsv1.1`, `tlsv1.2`, `tlsv1.3` [#9260](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9260).

- Remove useless information from the dashboard listener failure log [#9260](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9260).

- We now trigger the `'message.acked'` hook after the CoAP gateway sends a message to the device and receives the ACK from the device [#9264](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9264).
  With this change, the CoAP gateway can be combined with the offline message caching function (in the
  emqx enterprise), so that CoAP devices are able to read the missed messages from the database when
  it is online again.

- Support to use placeholders like `${var}` in the HTTP `Headers` of Rule-Engine's Webhook actions [#9239](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9239).

- Asynchronously refresh the resources and rules during emqx boot-up [#9199](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9199).
  This is to avoid slowing down the boot if some resources spend long time establishing the connection.

- Add a warning log if the ACL check failed for subscription [#9124](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9124).
  This is to make the ACL deny logging for subscription behave the same as for publish.

- JWT ACL claim supports `all` action to imply the rules applie to both `pub` and `sub` [#9044](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9044).

- Added a log censor to avoid logging sensitive data [#9189](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9189).
  If the data to be logged is a map or key-value list which contains sensitive key words such as `password`, the value is obfuscated as `******`.

- Enhanced log security in ACL modules, sensitive data will be obscured [#9242](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9242).

- Add `management.bootstrap_apps_file` configuration to bulk import default app/secret when EMQX initializes the database [#9273](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9273).

- Added two new configs for deterministic order of authentication and ACL checks [#9283](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9283).
  The two new global config names are `auth_order` and `acl_order`.
  When multiple ACL or auth plugins (or modules) are enabled, without this config, the order (in which each backend is queried)
  is determined by the start/restart order of the plugin (or module).
  Meaning, if a plugin (or module) is restarted after initial boot, it may get ordered to the end of the list.
  With this config, you may set the order with a comma-speapated ACL or auth plugin names (or aliases).
  For example: `acl_order = jwt,http`, this will make sure `jwt` is always checked before `http`,
  meaning if JWT is not found (or no `acl` cliam) for a client, then the ACL check will fallback to use the HTTP backend.

- Added configurations to enable more `client.disconnected` events (and counter bumps) [#9267](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9267).
  Prior to this change, the `client.disconnected` event (and counter bump) is triggered when a client
  performs a 'normal' disconnect, or is 'kicked' by system admin, but NOT triggered when a
  stale connection had to be 'discarded' (for clean session) or 'takeovered' (for non-clean session) by new connection.
  Now it is possible to set configs `broker.client_disconnect_discarded` and `broker.client_disconnect_takeovered` to `on` to enable the event in these scenarios.

- For Rule-Engine resource creation failure, delay before the first retry [#9313](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9313).
  Prior to this change, the retry delay was added *after* the retry failure.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed the option to choose the `reset_by_subscriber` offset reset
  policy in Kafka Consumer [#1463](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-enterprise/pull/1463).

- Added the missing `tlsv1.3` option to `tls_versions` in hot-config [#1532](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-enterprise/pull/1532).

- Made Rule-Engine able to connect SQL server when its listening port is not the default (`1433`) [#1464](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-enterprise/pull/1464).

- Make sure Schema-Registry API supports Percent-encoding `name` in HTTP request URI [#1497](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-enterprise/issues/1497).
  Note that the `name` in `POST /api/v4/schemas` request body should not be percent-encoded as it's a JSON field value.

- Fix an upgrade issue for JWT authentication plugin [#1554](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-enterprise/pull/1554).
  When upgrading from e4.3.9 or earlier, an EMQX internal resource which holds the keys will have to be restarted,
  during the restart, clients may fail to be authenticated.

- Fix that after uploading a backup file with an non-ASCII filename, HTTP API `GET /data/export` fails with status code 500 [#9224](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9224).

- Improve the display of rule's 'Maximum Speed' counter to only reserve 2 decimal places [#9185](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9185).
  This is to avoid displaying floats like `0.30000000000000004` on the dashboard.

- Fix the issue that emqx prints too many error logs when connecting to mongodb but auth failed [#9184](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9184).

- Fix that after receiving publish in `idle mode` the emqx-sn gateway may panic [#9024](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9024).

- "Pause due to rate limit" log level demoted from warning to notice [#9134](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9134).

- Restore old `emqx_auth_jwt` module API, so the hook callback functions registered in older version will not be invalidated after hot-upgrade [#9144](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9144).

- Fixed the response status code for the `/status` endpoint [#9210](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9210).
  Before the fix, it always returned `200` even if the EMQX application was not running.  Now it returns `503` in that case.

- Fix message delivery related event encoding [#9226](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9226)
  For Rule-Engine's input events like `$events/message_delivered`, and `$events/message_dropped`,
  if the message was delivered to a shared-subscription, the encoding (to JSON) of the event will fail.
  Affected versions: `v4.3.21`, `v4.4.10`, `e4.3.16` and `e4.4.10`.

- Make sure Rule-Engine API supports Percent-encoding `rule_id` and `resource_id` in HTTP request path [#9190](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9190).
  Note that the `id` in `POST /api/v4/rules` should be literals (not encoded) when creating a `rule` or `resource`.
  See docs [Create Rule](https://docs.emqx.com/en/enterprise/v4.4/advanced/http-api.html#post-api-v4-rules) [Create Resource](https://docs.emqx.com/en/enterprise/v4.4/advanced/http-api.html#post-api-v4-resources).

- Calling 'DELETE /alarms/deactivated' now deletes deactived alarms on all nodes, including remote nodes, not just the local node [#9280](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9280).

- When republishing messages or bridge messages to other brokers, check the validity of the topic and make sure it does not have topic wildcards [#9291](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9291).

- Disable authorization for `api/v4/emqx_prometheus` endpoint on management api listener (default 8081) [#9294](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9294).

## 4.3.16

*Release Date: 2022-10-14*

### Enhancements

- Added more Kafka action parameter checks
  - TCP send buffer size and max batch size parameters are not allowed to be left blank from the configration UI.
  - The combination of "Produce Strategy" set to 'key_dispatch' and the "Key" set to "none" is now not allowed,
    the dashboard will get an error with text like: "with strategy set to 'key_dispatch', key is not allowed to be 'none'"

- TLS listener memory usage optimization [#9005](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9005).
  New config `listener.ssl.$NAME.hibernate_after` to hibernate TLS connection process after idling.
  Hibernation can reduce RAM usage significantly, but may cost more CPU.
  This configuration is by default disabled.
  Our preliminary test shows a 50% of RAM usage decline when configured to '5s'.

- TLS listener default buffer size to 4KB [#9007](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9007).
  Eliminate uncertainty that the buffer size is set by OS default.

- Disable authorization for `api/v4/emqx_prometheus` endpoint [#8955](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8955).

- Added a test to prevent a last will testament message to be
  published when a client is denied connection [#8894](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8894).

- More rigorous checking of flapping to improve stability of the system [#9045](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9045).

- QoS1 and QoS2 messages in session's buffer are re-dispatched to other members in the group
  when the session terminates [#9094](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9094).
  Prior to this enhancement, one would have to set `broker.shared_dispatch_ack_enabled` to `true`
  to prevent sessions from buffering messages, however this acknowledgement costs extra resources.

- Fix delayed publish timing inaccuracy caused by OS time change [#8908](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8908).

### Bug fixes

- Fix `load_modules` reset after new node joins the cluster.
  Prior to this fix, if `load_modules` for a cluster has been changed, adding a new node to the cluster with default modules
  would cause the other nodes to reset to default too.
  In this fix, the node which is going to join the cluster will copy the `loaded_modules` from the oldest node in the cluster.

- Fix getting subscriptions from backends successfully with QoS values out of range [0, 2].
  Before this change, when we add subscriptions for clients from backends like Redis or MySQL, we won't validate the QoS.
  For example if the QoS is an integer -1, the topic was still subscribed successfully with QoS -1,
  if we send a message to this topic, then an error will occur and the MQTT connection will crash.
  After this change QoS will be clamped into range [0, 2].

- Fix Rule-Engine increased 'success' counter when get subscriptions from Redis failed (due to query Redis timeout).

- Fix Rule-Engine increased 'success' counter when saving offline messages with QoS = 0.
  We don't allow saving offline messages to backends with QoS = 0, so we need to increase the 'failed' counter instead of the 'success' counter in this case.

- Fix the `verify` field is missing from the SSL settings of redis-cluster and redis-sentinel resources.

- Fixed Redis resource liveness problem issue. Prior to this fix, the resource is considered alive when connection can be established.
  The fix is to perform a PING query to make sure the service is alive.

- Fix the redis-cluster resource prints too many error logs when Redis servers are not avaliable.

- Fixed an internal Redis resource ID clashing. This clashing may cause resources in use getting deleted when deleting another resource.

- Mask secret/password in the resource/module creation UI.

- Fix HTTP client library to handle SSL socket passive signal [#9145](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9145).

- Hide Redis password in error logs [#9071](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9071).
  More changes in Redis client included in this release:
  - Improve Redis connection error logging [eredis#19](https://github.com/emqx/eredis/pull/19).
    Also added support for eredis to accept an anonymous function as password instead of
    passing around plaintext args which may get dumpped to crash logs (hard to predict where).
    This change also added `format_status` callback for `gen_server` states which hold plaintext
    password so the process termination log and `sys:get_status` will print '******' instead of
    the password to console.
  - Avoid pool name clashing [eredis_cluster#22](<https://github.com/emqx/eredis_cluster/pull/22>.
    Same `format_status` callback is added here too for `gen_server`s which hold password in
    their state.

- Fix shared subscription message re-dispatches [#9094](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9094).
  - When discarding QoS 2 inflight messages, there were excessive logs
  - For wildcard deliveries, the re-dispatch used the wrong topic (the publishing topic,
    but not the subscribing topic), caused messages to be lost when dispatching.

- Fix shared subscription group member unsubscribe issue when 'sticky' strategy is used.
  Prior to this fix, if a previously picked member unsubscribes from the group (without reconnect)
  the message is still dispatched to it.
  This issue only occurs when unsubscribe with the session kept.
  Fixed in [#9119](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9119)

- Fix shared subscription 'sticky' strategy when there is no local subscriptions at all.
  Prior to this change, it may take a few rounds to randomly pick group members until a local subscriber
  is hit (and then start sticking to it).
  After this fix, it will start sticking to whichever randomly picked member even when it is a
  subscriber from another node in the cluster.
  Fixed in [#9122](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9122)

- Fix rule engine fallback actions metrics reset [#9125](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9125).

## 4.3.7

*Release Date: 2022-02-11*

### Important

A cluster-wide total connections calculation bug was fixed in in EMQX Enterprise 4.3.7. Previously only the individual node's local number of connections were checked against the max number of connections allowed by the license. After this fix, the total number of connections is aggregated cluster-wide every 5 seconds. An extra 10% overrun is allowed to compensate the delays in aggregation.

Users planning to upgrade should be aware of the possibility that this change may cause clients to reach the license limit and not be able to connect.

## 4.0.0

*Release Date: 2020-01-10*

### Introduction

EMQ X 4.0.0 is a major release.

In this version we significantly improved the throughput of the broker by refactoring the session and channel, improved the extensibility and monitorability by adding more hooks and counters, redesigned rule-engine SQL to filtering messages/events mainly by topics. And also lots of improvements in REST APIs, authentication plugins, and the MQTT client.

### The Broker

- Improved the throughput of the broker:

    The session process is removed. Now all the logics about session and connection are put into a single process. This significantly improves the throughput of the broker. **In one of our benchmarks, we've achieved throughput max to 1 million TPS of QoS0 messages on a single node with 16 CPU cores. And another test shows emqx is able to handle 2 million concurrent connections on a single node without any problem using only about 17G memory**. See the benchmark reports of emqx v4.0.0 for more information.

- Optimized handling of MQTT packets:

    The handling of MQTT packets is changed a lot to make a cleaner code base. See the module emqx\_channel for more infomation.

- Improved the metrics:

    We've renamed some counters and also added more counters:

  - client.connect
  - client.connack
  - client.connected
  - client.authenticate
  - client.check\_acl
  - client.subscribe
  - client.unsubscribe
  - client.disconnected
  - session.created
  - session.resumed
  - session.takeovered
  - session.discarded
  - session.terminated
- Improved the hooks:

    We've modified parameters of some hooks and also added more hook-points:

  - client.connect: MQTT CONNECT Packet Received
  - client.connack: MQTT CONNACK Packet Sent
  - client.connected: The MQTT Client is connected
  - client.disconnected: The MQTT Client is disconnected
  - client.authenticate: Authenticate the MQTT Client
  - client.check\_acl: Check Pub/Sub ACL
  - client.subscribe: MQTT SUBSCRIBE Packet Received
  - client.unsubscribe: MQTT UNSUBSCRIBE Packet Received
  - session.created: A new session is created
  - session.subscribed: After session subscribed a topic
  - session.unsubscribed: After session unsubscribed a topic
  - session.resumed: A session is resumed
  - session.takeovered: A session is takeovered
  - session.discarded: A session is discarded
  - session.terminated: A session is terminated
  - message.publish: A message is published
  - message.delivered: A message is delivered
  - message.acked: A messaeg is acked
  - message.dropped: A message is dropped due to no subscribers
- Fixed the issue that failure of SSL handshake would crash the process:

    To defend the process crash and give a readable error log message if SSL handshake failed.

- Fixed the issue that `max_subscriptions` not working:

    Fixed the issue that the `zone.external.max_subscriptions` in emqx.conf not working. See [emqx/emqx#2908](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/issues/2908) for more information.

- Fixed message out-of-order issues when forwarding across clusters:

    The inter-node messages are sent via multiple RPC channels, and the strategy of choosing the channels is `random` by default. This causes the messages of the same topic out-of-order after being sent to the other node. We changed the default strategy to hashed by topic in this fix.

- Fixed the issue that REST API and CLI cannot get multiple routes for a topic:

    See [emqx/emqx-management#150](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-management/pull/150) for more information.

### REST API

- Supported IPv6 in REST APIs:

    IPv6 is now supported in all REST APIs.

- The default listening port for the HTTP API server is changed from 8080 to 8081:

    The old default port of management APIs 8080 is easily conflicted with other services running on the same node. We changed it defaults to 8081.

- Redesgin the APIs for sessions and connections:

    The session in emqx is now a concept part of the clients. `connections` APIs are changed to `clients` APIs, and the new APIs support all the old features was in session APIs.

- Support returning the real topic of shared subscription in the subscriptions API:

    Now the shared subscriptions are shown in the form of '$shared//topic'.

- Support configuring the default AppID and AppSecret:

    Now default AppID and AppSecret can be configured in etc/emqx\_management.conf.

- The HTTP API for publishing message now supports base64 encoded payload:

    Some users may want to publish binary message over HTTP APIs. From this feature they can do that by sending a base64 encoded payload.

- Fix the issue that encoded URI isn't handled correctly:

    The API for deleting banned clients was not handling the percent encoded URL before this fix.

### Authentication Plugins

- Support defining HTTP request headers in config files.

- Support configuring the default clientids and usernames in config files:

    This feature was removed from emqx v3.0, and is added again now.

### MQTT Client ([emqtt](https://github.com/emqx/emqtt))

- emqtt provides command line interfaces for publishing and subscribing.

### Rule Engine ([emqx-rule-engine](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-rule-engine))

- Redesigned the SQL for rule engine:

    SQL for rule-engine is changed a little bit in its `FROM` clause. The old syntax looks like:

    `SELECT * FROM "message.publish"`

    But now it is changed to:

    `SELECT * FROM "t/#"`

    So it is now filtering messages/events mainly by topics.

    This change stops rule engine from processing the `SELECT` clause if the topic is not matched, so improved the performance.
