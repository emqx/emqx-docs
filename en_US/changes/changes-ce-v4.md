# Version 4

## 4.4.19

*Release Date: 2023-06-27*

### Enhancements

- Added support for TCP keep-alive in MQTT/TCP and MQTT/SSL listeners [#10854](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10854).

  A new configuration option has been added: `zone.<zone-name>.tcp_keepalive = Idle,Interval,Probes`. Users can enable the TCP layer's Keep Alive feature and specify time parameters using this configuration. This configuration is only effective on Linux and MacOS systems.

- Improved error logs related to Proxy Protocol [emqx/esockd#177](https://github.com/emqx/esockd/pull/177).

  The sample logs before this improvement:
  ```
  2023-04-20T14:56:51.671735+08:00 [error] supervisor: 'esockd_connection_sup - <0.2537.0>', errorContext: connection_shutdown, reason: {invalid_proxy_info,<<"f\n">>}, offender: [{pid,<0.3192.0>},{name,connection},{mfargs,{...}}]

  2023-04-20T14:57:01.348275+08:00 [error] supervisor: 'esockd_connection_sup - <0.2537.0>', errorContext: connection_shutdown, reason: {proxy_proto_timeout,5000}, offender: [{pid,<0.3194.0>},{name,connection},{mfargs,{...}}]
  ```
  After the improvement:
  ```
  2023-04-20T18:07:06.180134+08:00 [error] [esockd_proxy_protocol] The listener 127.0.0.1:8883 is working in proxy protocol mode, but received invalid proxy_protocol header, raw_bytes=<<"f\n">>

  2023-04-20T18:10:17.205436+08:00 [error] [esockd_proxy_protocol] The listener 127.0.0.1:8883 is working in proxy protocol mode, but timed out while waiting for proxy_protocol header
  ```

- Added a new feature to enable partial certificate chain validation for TLS listeners [#10553](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10553).

  For details please checkout the `listener.ssl.external.partial_chain` in the `emqx.conf` config file.

- Added a new feature to enable client certificate extended key usage validation for TLS listeners [#10669](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10669).

  For details please checkout the `listener.ssl.external.verify_peer_ext_key_usage` in the `emqx.conf` config file.

- Added the `live_connections` field in the HTTP API `/api/v4/nodes` response [#10859](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10859).

  Previously, this interface had a `connections` field, which represented the number of active connections on the current node that had not expired. This means that even if the MQTT connection has been disconnected, as long as the client has a persistent session, it would still be counted in the `connections` field. The newly added `live_connections` field specifically counts the number of clients with MQTT connections that have not been disconnected.

- Added 3 random SQL functions to the rule engine [#11113](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11113).

  - random(): Generates a random number between 0 and 1 (0.0 =< X < 1.0).
  - uuid_v4(): Generates a random UUID (version 4) string.
  - uuid_v4_no_hyphen(): Generates a random UUID (version 4) string without hyphens.

- Added numerical range validation (23-65535) for the `mqtt.max_clientid_len` configuration parameter [#11096](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11096).

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where the rule engine was unable to access variables exported by `FOREACH` in the `DO` clause [#10620](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10620).

  Given a payload: `{"date": "2023-05-06", "array": ["a"]}`, as well as the following SQL statement:
  ```
  FOREACH payload.date as date, payload.array as elem
  DO date, elem
  FROM "t/#"
  ```
  Prior to the fix, the `date` variable exported by `FOREACH` could not be accessed in the `DO` clause of the above SQL, resulting in the following output for the SQL statement:
  `[{"elem": "a","date": "undefined"}]`.
  After the fix, the output of the SQL statement is: `[{"elem": "a","date": "2023-05-06"}]`

- Fixed the issue where the cache of rules failed to update in certain cases [#11072](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11072).

  Prior to the fix, after manually updating the rules, there could be instances where the cache update did not synchronize to certain nodes. This would result in inconsistent rule execution states across different nodes.

- Fixed an issue where the WebHook plugin failed to execute the `on_client_connack` hook [#10710](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10710).

  See https://github.com/emqx/emqx/issues/10628 for more details.

## 4.4.18

*Release Date: 2023-04-28*

### Enhancements

- Improved the placeholder syntax of the rule engine [#10470](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10470).

  The parameters of certain actions support using placeholder syntax to dynamically fill in the content of strings. The format of the placeholder syntax is `${key}`.\
  Prior to the improvement, the `key` in `${key}` could only contain letters, numbers, and underscores. Now the `key` supports any UTF8 character after the improvement.


## 4.4.17

*Release Date: 2023-04-13*

### Enhancements

- When the listener enabled with `Proxy Protocol` receives a TCP port probe, no error logs will be printed anymore [emqx/esockd#172](https://github.com/emqx/esockd/pull/172).

  Before the fix, if the listener had enabled the proxy protocol (`listener.tcp.external.proxy_protocol=on`), but the connection was disconnected after the TCP handshake was completed and before the proxy information was received, the following error log would be printed:

  ```
  [error] supervisor: 'esockd_connection_sup - <0.3265.0>', errorContext: connection_shutdown, reason: {recv_proxy_info_error,tcp_closed}, offender:
  ```
  After the fix, no logs will be printed, but you can still view the error reason statistics through the `emqx_ctl listeners` command.

- Improved the error logs of the listener for file descriptor exhaustion [emqx/esockd#173](https://github.com/emqx/esockd/pull/173).

  Before the improvement, the log was:
  ```
  [error] Accept error on 0.0.0.0:1883: emfile
  ```
  After the improvement, the log became:
  ```
  [error] Accept error on 0.0.0.0:1883: EMFILE (Too many open files)
  ```

- Improved the performance of the rule engine when there are many rules [#10283](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10283)

  Before the improvement, when there were many rules, the rule engine would consume a lot of CPU time on rule queries and matching, becoming a performance bottleneck.
  In this optimization, by simply adding a cache to the rule list, the rule execution efficiency in this scenario was greatly improved.
  In our test, we created 700 rules that did not perform any actions (bound to the "do_nothing" debugging action) on a 32-core 32G virtual machine, and sent MQTT messages to EMQX at a rate of 1000 messages per second (that is, the rule trigger frequency was 700 * 1000 times per second).
  In the above scenario, the CPU usage of the optimized rule engine dropped to 55% ~ 60% of the previous level.

### Fixes

- Fixed the issue where `Erlang distribution` could not use TLS [#9981](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9981).

  For more information on `Erlang distribution`, see [here](https://www.emqx.io/docs/en/v4.4/advanced/cluster.html).

- Fixed the issue where MQTT bridging could not verify TLS certificates with wildcard domains on the peer side [#10094](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10094).

- Fixed the issue where EMQX could not timely clear the information of disconnected MQTT connections when there were too many messages backlogged in the retainer. [#10189](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10189).

  Before the fix, the `emqx_retainer` plugin and the EMQX connection information cleanup task shared a process pool. Therefore, if the process pool was blocked by a large number of retain message distribution tasks, many disconnected MQTT connection information would not be cleared in time. See [#9409](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/issues/9409) for details.
  After the fix, the `emqx_retainer` plugin uses a separate process pool to avoid this problem.

- Fixed the issue where the path of the template file `service-monitor.yaml` in the Helm Chart was incorrect. [#10229](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10229)

## 4.4.16

*Release Date: 2023-03-10*

### Enhancements

- Change "EMQX" to "EMQX" from the outputs of CLIs and names of plugins [#10099](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10099).

### Bug fixes

- Avoid changing the payload of MQTT messages when printing debug logs [#10091](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10091).
  Before this fix, if EMQX receives a message with Payload "e\ne\nc\nc\n2\n\n\n", the log message will be as follows:
  ```
  2023-03-08T13:28:04.320622+08:00 [debug] mqttx_e34bd582@127.0.0.1:54020 [MQTT] RECV PUBLISH(Q1, R0, D0, Topic=t/1, PacketId=39467, Payload=e, e, c, c, 2, , , )
  ```
  This is the corresponding log message now:
  ```
  2023-03-08T14:26:50.935575+08:00 [debug] mqttx_e34bd582@127.0.0.1:54020 [MQTT] RECV PUBLISH(Q1, R0, D0, Topic=t/1, PacketId=39467, Payload=<<"e\ne\nc\nc\n2\n\n\n">>)
  ```

## 4.4.15

*Release Date: 2023-03-03*

This version update includes 8 enhancements and 13 fixes.
Among the enhancements, there are new exciting new features worth highlighting:

- Upgrade the MongoDB client library of EMQX to support MongoDB 5.1 and above.
- Dashboard supports the proxy protocol of HAProxy.
- Release the Ubuntu 22.04 installation package.

### Enhancements

- The MongoDB library has been upgraded to support MongoDB version 5.1 and greater.

- Support proxy protocol of HAProxy for dashboard API [9803](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9803).

- Added Ubuntu 22.04 package release [#9831](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9831).

- Improve the integration of the `banned` and the `delayed` feature [#9790](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9790).
  Now when publishing a delayed message will check first if its source client is banned, if true, this publish will be ignored.

- Security enhancement for retained messages [#9790](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9790).
  The retained messages will not be published if the publisher client is banned.

- Now the corresponding session will be kicked when client is banned by `clientid` [#9904](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9904).

- Add more debug logs for authentication and ACL [#9943](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9943).

- Expose the stats `live_connections.count` and `live_connections.max` to Prometheus [#9929](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9929).

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an error when forward MQTT messages with User-Property using the `republish` action [#9942](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9942).

- fix some issues in descriptions of the actions, resources and emqx-modules [#9931](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9931).

- fix there's no error logs when query the JWKS server failed [#9931](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9931).

- The returned client lists of HTTP query `GET /api/v4/clients?_page=2&_limit=20` to different nodes might be inconsistent [#9926](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9926).

- Fix the problem that new MQTT TLS connections failed to establish after release hot upgrade [#9810](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9810).
  For more detailed information please see: [emqx/esockd#170](https://github.com/emqx/esockd/pull/170).

- Fix a problem in the log message format of MQTT packets [#9858](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9858).
  Before this fix, a comma was missing between the flags (DUP) of the fixed header
  and the fields (ClientId) of the variable header:
  ```
  2023-01-29T13:40:36.567692+08:00 [debug] 127.0.0.1:50393 [MQTT] RECV CONNECT(Q0, R0, D0ClientId=test_client, ... Password=undefined)
  ```

- Avoid crash logs in CoAP gateway when receiving liveness checking packets from Load Balancer [#9869](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9869).

- Fix the exclusive topics aren't removed when the session has already been cleaned [#9868](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9868).

- fix the EMQX reports `{case_clause,{error,closed}}` error log message when websocket connections interrupted [emqx/cowboy#8](https://github.com/emqx/cowboy/pull/8).

- fix sometimes the rules cannot be enabled automatically after EMQX is restarted [#9911](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9911).

- fix the `{badarg,[{ets,lookup,[gproc,{shared, ...` error logs during shutdown [#9919](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9919).

- Delete the files directory when `resources` were deleted to avoid files leaking [#10039](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10039).

## 4.4.11

*Release Date: 2022-11-26*

This release included 18 enhancements and 14 bug fixes.
Among the enhancements, therer are new exciting new features worth highlighting.

- OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) Stapling.
- CRL (Certificate Revocation List) cache.
- OTP upgrade from 24.1.5-3 to 24.3.4.2-1.
- Customizable client aliases to make it easier to when creating customized authentication and authorization.

It is possible to hot-upgrade from older version v4.4 to this version.
Please note though, in order to start making use of the new features such as OCSP Stapling, CRL cache,
a node restart (and configuration change) is required.

### Enhancements

- OTP upgrade from 24.1.5-3 to 24.3.4.2-1 [#9265](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9265).
  Change highlights:
    - Erlang/OTP [SSL library vulnerability fix](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-37026)
    - Added support for OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) Stapling
    - Added CRL (Certificate Revocation List) cache auto refresh

- Added support for OCSP stapling and CRL
  caching [#9297](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9297).

- Added support for specifying custom modules for adding clientid and common name
  aliases [#9297](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9297).
  Now you can implement a simple callback to enrich clients with aliases, and then use the aliases
  in the authentication and authorization (ACL) rules' place holders (`%cida` for clientid alias
  and `%cna` for username alias).

- Added support for specifying custom modules for custom authentication [#9297](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9297).
  To support simple authentication rules, it is no longer necessary to implement a full-blown plugin.

- Added a JWT management for Rule-Engine, for creating and refreshing JWT tokens in rule engine actions [#9241](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9241).
  This feature is so far only used in EMQX Enterprise Google PubSub integration.
  Can be used as webhook integration's JWT authentication against the webhook service endpoint.

- Make sure listener's `tls_versions` config value is one or more of `tlsv1`, `tlsv1.1`, `tlsv1.2`, `tlsv1.3` [#9260](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9260).

- Remove useless information from the dashboard listener failure log [#9260](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9260).

- We now trigger the `'message.acked'` hook after the CoAP gateway sends a message to the device and receives the ACK from the device [#9264](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9264).
  With this change, the CoAP gateway can be combined with the offline message caching function (in the
  emqx enterprise), so that CoAP devices are able to read the missed messages from the database when
  it is online again.

- Support to use placeholders like `${var}` in the HTTP `Headers` of rule-engine's Webhook actions [#9239](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9239).

- Asynchronously refresh the resources and rules during emqx boot-up [#9199](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9199).
  This is to avoid slowing down the boot if some resources spend long time establishing the connection.

- Add a warning log if the ACL check failed for subscription [#9124](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9124).
  This is to make the ACL deny logging for subscription behave the same as for publish.

- JWT ACL claim supports `all` action to imply the rules applie to both `pub` and `sub` [#9044](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9044).

- Added a log censor to avoid logging sensitive data [#9189](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9189).
  If the data to be logged is a map or key-value list which contains sensitive key words such as `password`, the value is obfuscated as `******`.

- Enhanced log security in ACL modules, sensitive data will be obscured [#9242](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9242).

- Add `management.bootstrap_apps_file` configuration to bulk import default app/secret when EMQX initializes the database [#9273](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9273).

- Added two new configs for deterministic order of authentication and ACL checks [#9283](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9283).
  The two new global config names are `auth_order` and `acl_order`.
  When multiple ACL or auth plugins (or modules) are enabled, without this config, the order (in which each backend is queried)
  is determined by the start/restart order of the plugin (or module).
  Meaning, if a plugin (or module) is restarted after initial boot, it may get ordered to the end of the list.
  With this config, you may set the order with a comma-speapated ACL or auth plugin names (or aliases).
  For example: `acl_order = jwt,http`, this will make sure `jwt` is always checked before `http`,
  meaning if JWT is not found (or no `acl` cliam) for a client, then the ACL check will fallback to use the HTTP backend.

- Added configurations to enable more `client.disconnected` events (and counter bumps) [#9267](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9267).
  Prior to this change, the `client.disconnected` event (and counter bump) is triggered when a client
  performs a 'normal' disconnect, or is 'kicked' by system admin, but NOT triggered when a
  stale connection had to be 'discarded' (for clean session) or 'takeovered' (for non-clean session) by new connection.
  Now it is possible to set configs `broker.client_disconnect_discarded` and `broker.client_disconnect_takeovered` to `on` to enable the event in these scenarios.

- For Rule-Engine resource creation failure, delay before the first retry [#9313](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9313).
  Prior to this change, the retry delay was added *after* the retry failure.

### Bug fixes

- Fix get trace list crash when trace not initialize. [#9156](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9156)

- Fix create trace sometime failed by end_at time has already passed. [#9156](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9156)

- Fix that after uploading a backup file with an non-ASCII filename, HTTP API `GET /data/export` fails with status code 500 [#9224](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9224).

- Improve the display of rule's 'Maximum Speed' counter to only reserve 2 decimal places [#9185](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9185).
  This is to avoid displaying floats like `0.30000000000000004` on the dashboard.

- Fix the issue that emqx prints too many error logs when connecting to mongodb but auth failed [#9184](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9184).

- Fix that after receiving publish in `idle mode` the emqx-sn gateway may panic [#9024](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9024).

- "Pause due to rate limit" log level demoted from warning to notice [#9134](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9134).

- Restore old `emqx_auth_jwt` module API, so the hook callback functions registered in older version will not be invalidated after hot-upgrade [#9144](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9144).

- Fixed the response status code for the `/status` endpoint [#9210](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9210).
  Before the fix, it always returned `200` even if the EMQX application was not running.  Now it returns `503` in that case.

- Fix message delivery related event encoding [#9226](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9226)
  For rule-engine's input events like `$events/message_delivered`, and `$events/message_dropped`,
  if the message was delivered to a shared-subscription, the encoding (to JSON) of the event will fail.
  Affected versions: `v4.3.21`, `v4.4.10`, `e4.3.16` and `e4.4.10`.

- Make sure Rule-Engine API supports Percent-encoding `rule_id` and `resource_id` in HTTP request path [#9190](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9190).
  Note that the `id` in `POST /api/v4/rules` should be literals (not encoded) when creating a `rule` or `resource`.
  See docs [Create Rule](https://docs.emqx.com/en/enterprise/v4.4/advanced/http-api.html#post-api-v4-rules) [Create Resource](https://docs.emqx.com/en/enterprise/v4.4/advanced/http-api.html#post-api-v4-resources).

- Calling 'DELETE /alarms/deactivated' now deletes deactived alarms on all nodes, including remote nodes, not just the local node [#9280](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9280).

- When republishing messages or bridge messages to other brokers, check the validity of the topic and make sure it does not have topic wildcards [#9291](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9291).

- Disable authorization for `api/v4/emqx_prometheus` endpoint on management api listener (default 8081) [#9294](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9294).

## 4.4.10

*Release Date: 2022-10-14*

### Enhancements

- TLS listener memory usage optimization [#9005](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9005).
  New config `listener.ssl.$NAME.hibernate_after` to hibernate TLS connection process after idling.
  Hibernation can reduce RAM usage significantly, but may cost more CPU.
  This configuration is by default disabled.
  Our preliminary test shows a 50% of RAM usage decline when configured to '5s'.

- TLS listener default buffer size to 4KB [#9007](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9007)
  Eliminate uncertainty that the buffer size is set by OS default.

- Disable authorization for `api/v4/emqx_prometheus` endpoint [#8955](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8955).

- Added a test to prevent a last will testament message to be
  published when a client is denied connection [#8894](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8894).

- More rigorous checking of flapping to improve stability of the system [#9045](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9045).
  Previsouly only normal disconnects are counted, now the connection rejections (e.g. authentication failure) is also included.
  Find more about flapping detection in [EMQX document](https://www.emqx.io/docs/en/v4.3/configuration/configuration.html#flapping-detect-policy)

- QoS1 and QoS2 messages in session's buffer are re-dispatched to other members in the group
  when the session terminates [#9094](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9094).
  Prior to this enhancement, one would have to set `broker.shared_dispatch_ack_enabled` to `true`
  to prevent sessions from buffering messages, however this acknowledgement costs extra resources.

- Fix delayed publish timing inaccuracy caused by OS time change [#8908](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8908).

### Bug fixes

- Fix the latency statistics error of the slow subscription module when `stats_type` is `internal` or `response` [#8981](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8981).

- Fix HTTP client library to handle SSL socket passive signal [#9145](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9145).

- Hide redis password in error logs [#9071](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9071)
  In this change, it also included more changes in redis client:
  - Improve redis connection error logging [eredis#19](https://github.com/emqx/eredis/pull/19).
    Also added support for eredis to accept an anonymous function as password instead of
    passing around plaintext args which may get dumpped to crash logs (hard to predict where).
    This change also added `format_status` callback for `gen_server` states which hold plaintext
    password so the process termination log and `sys:get_status` will print '******' instead of
    the password to console.
  - Avoid pool name clashing [eredis_cluster#22](https://github.com/emqx/eredis_cluster/pull/22).
    Same `format_status` callback is added here too for `gen_server`s which hold password in
    their state.

- Fix shared subscription message re-dispatches [#9094](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9094).
  - When discarding QoS 2 inflight messages, there were excessive logs
  - For wildcard deliveries, the re-dispatch used the wrong topic (the publishing topic,
    but not the subscribing topic), caused messages to be lost when dispatching.

- Fix shared subscription group member unsubscribe issue when 'sticky' strategy is used.
  Prior to this fix, if a previously picked member unsubscribes from the group (without reconnect)
  the message is still dispatched to it.
  This issue only occurs when unsubscribe with the session kept.
  Fixed in [#9119](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9119)

- Fix shared subscription 'sticky' strategy when there is no local subscriptions at all.
  Prior to this change, it may take a few rounds to randomly pick group members until a local subscriber
  is hit (and then start sticking to it).
  After this fix, it will start sticking to whichever randomly picked member even when it is a
  subscriber from another node in the cluster.
  Fixed in [#9122](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9122)

- Fix rule engine fallback actions metrics reset [#9125](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9125).

## 4.4.9

*Release Date: 2022-09-17*

### Enhancements

- The `exp`, `nbf` and `iat` claims in JWT authentication support non-integer timestamps

### Bug fixes

## 4.4.2

*Release Date: 2022-04-01*
### Important changes

- For Docker images, the configuration directory `/opt/emqx/etc` has been removed from the VOLUME list, making it easier for users to rebuild images with changed configurations.
- CentOS 7 Erlang runtime rebuilt on OpenSSL-1.1.1n (previously 1.0), prior to v4.3.13, EMQX will fail to handshake and trigger `malformed_handshake_data` exception when clients use certain cipher suites.

## 4.4.1

*Release Date: 2022-02-21*

This patch release only includes a CI change for the Windows package.

## 4.4.0

*Release Date: 2022-02-18*

NOTE:

- 4.4.0 is in sync with: 4.3.12.
- The build of Windows package has some issues in the current version, we will fix it in the next version

The compare base of this change set is 4.3.12

### Important changes

- **For Debian/Ubuntu users**, Debian/Ubuntu package (deb) installed EMQX is now started from systemd.
  This is to use systemd's supervision functionality to ensure that EMQX service restarts after a crash.
  The package installation service upgrade from init.d to systemd has been verified,
  it is still recommended that you verify and confirm again before deploying to the production environment,
  at least to ensure that systemd is available in your system

- Package name scheme changed comparing to 4.3.
  4.3 format: emqx-centos8-4.3.8-amd64.zip
  4.4 format: emqx-4.4.0-rc.1-otp24.1.5-3-el8-amd64.zip
  * Erlang/OTP version is included in the package name,
    providing the possibility to release EMQX on multiple Erlang/OTP versions
  * `centos` is renamed to `el`. This is mainly due to centos8 being dead (replaced with rockylinux8)

- MongoDB authentication supports DNS SRV and TXT Records resolution, which can seamlessly connect with MongoDB Altas

- Support dynamic modification of MQTT Keep Alive to adapt to different energy consumption strategies.

- Support 4.3 to 4.4 rolling upgrade of clustered nodes. See upgrade document for more dtails.

- TLS for cluster backplane (RPC) connections. See clustering document for more details.

- Add new feature for `slow subscription` to count the time spent in the process of message transmission, and record and display the time-consuming clients and topics.

- Add new feature for `online log tracing` to support real-time tracing of client events and viewing on the dashboard.

### Minor changes

- Bumped default boot wait time from 15 seconds to 150 seconds
  because in some simulated environments it may take up to 70 seconds to boot in build CI

- Dashboard supports relative paths and custom access paths

- Supports configuring whether to forward retained messages with empty payload to suit users
  who are still using MQTT v3.1. The relevant configurable item is `retainer.stop_publish_clear_msg`

- Multi-language hook extension (ExHook) supports dynamic cancellation of subsequent forwarding of client messages

- Rule engine SQL supports the use of single quotes in `FROM` clauses, for example: `SELECT * FROM 't/#'`

- Change the default value of the `max_topic_levels` configurable item to 128.
  Previously, it had no limit (configured to 0), which may be a potential DoS threat

- Improve the error log content when the Proxy Protocol message is received without `proxy_protocol` configured.

- Add additional message attributes to the message reported by the gateway.
  Messages from gateways such as CoAP, LwM2M, Stomp, ExProto, etc., when converted to EMQX messages,
  add fields such as protocol name, protocol version, user name, client IP, etc.,
  which can be used for multi-language hook extension (ExHook)

- HTTP client performance improvement

- Add openssl-1.1 to RPM dependency

## 4.3.22

*Release Date: 2022-11-26*

### Enhancements

- Make sure listener's `tls_versions` config value is one or more of `tlsv1`, `tlsv1.1`, `tlsv1.2`, `tlsv1.3` [#9260](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9260).

- Remove useless information from the dashboard listener failure log [#9260](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9260).

- We now trigger the `'message.acked'` hook after the CoAP gateway sends a message to the device and receives the ACK from the device [#9264](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9264).
  With this change, the CoAP gateway can be combined with the offline message caching function (in the
  emqx enterprise), so that CoAP devices are able to read the missed messages from the database when
  it is online again.

- Support to use placeholders like `${var}` in the HTTP `Headers` of rule-engine's Webhook actions [#9239](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9239).

- Asynchronously refresh the resources and rules during emqx boot-up [#9199](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9199).
  This is to avoid slowing down the boot if some resources spend long time establishing the connection.

- Add a warning log if the ACL check failed for subscription [#9124](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9124).
  This is to make the ACL deny logging for subscription behave the same as for publish.

- JWT ACL claim supports `all` action to imply the rules applie to both `pub` and `sub` [#9044](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9044).

- Added a log censor to avoid logging sensitive data [#9189](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9189).
  If the data to be logged is a map or key-value list which contains sensitive key words such as `password`, the value is obfuscated as `******`.

- Enhanced log security in ACL modules, sensitive data will be obscured [#9242](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9242).

- Add `management.bootstrap_apps_file` configuration to bulk import default app/secret when EMQX initializes the database [#9273](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9273).

- Added two new configs for deterministic order of authentication and ACL checks [#9283](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9283).
  The two new global config names are `auth_order` and `acl_order`.
  When multiple ACL or auth plugins (or modules) are enabled, without this config, the order (in which each backend is queried)
  is determined by the start/restart order of the plugin (or module).
  Meaning, if a plugin (or module) is restarted after initial boot, it may get ordered to the end of the list.
  With this config, you may set the order with a comma-speapated ACL or auth plugin names (or aliases).
  For example: `acl_order = jwt,http`, this will make sure `jwt` is always checked before `http`,
  meaning if JWT is not found (or no `acl` cliam) for a client, then the ACL check will fallback to use the HTTP backend.

- Added configurations to enable more `client.disconnected` events (and counter bumps) [#9267](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9267).
  Prior to this change, the `client.disconnected` event (and counter bump) is triggered when a client
  performs a 'normal' disconnect, or is 'kicked' by system admin, but NOT triggered when a
  stale connection had to be 'discarded' (for clean session) or 'takeovered' (for non-clean session) by new connection.
  Now it is possible to set configs `broker.client_disconnect_discarded` and `broker.client_disconnect_takeovered` to `on` to enable the event in these scenarios.

- For Rule-Engine resource creation failure, delay before the first retry [#9313](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9313).
  Prior to this change, the retry delay was added *after* the retry failure.

### Bug fixes

- Fix that after uploading a backup file with an non-ASCII filename, HTTP API `GET /data/export` fails with status code 500 [#9224](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9224).

- Improve the display of rule's 'Maximum Speed' counter to only reserve 2 decimal places [#9185](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9185).
  This is to avoid displaying floats like `0.30000000000000004` on the dashboard.

- Fix the issue that emqx prints too many error logs when connecting to mongodb but auth failed [#9184](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9184).

- Fix that after receiving publish in `idle mode` the emqx-sn gateway may panic [#9024](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9024).

- "Pause due to rate limit" log level demoted from warning to notice [#9134](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9134).

- Restore old `emqx_auth_jwt` module API, so the hook callback functions registered in older version will not be invalidated after hot-upgrade [#9144](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9144).

- Fixed the response status code for the `/status` endpoint [#9210](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9210).
  Before the fix, it always returned `200` even if the EMQX application was not running.  Now it returns `503` in that case.

- Fix message delivery related event encoding [#9226](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9226)
  For rule-engine's input events like `$events/message_delivered`, and `$events/message_dropped`,
  if the message was delivered to a shared-subscription, the encoding (to JSON) of the event will fail.
  Affected versions: `v4.3.21`, `v4.4.10`, `e4.3.16` and `e4.4.10`.

- Make sure Rule-Engine API supports Percent-encoding `rule_id` and `resource_id` in HTTP request path [#9190](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9190).
  Note that the `id` in `POST /api/v4/rules` should be literals (not encoded) when creating a `rule` or `resource`.
  See docs [Create Rule](https://docs.emqx.com/en/enterprise/v4.4/advanced/http-api.html#post-api-v4-rules) [Create Resource](https://docs.emqx.com/en/enterprise/v4.4/advanced/http-api.html#post-api-v4-resources).

- Calling 'DELETE /alarms/deactivated' now deletes deactived alarms on all nodes, including remote nodes, not just the local node [#9280](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9280).

- When republishing messages or bridge messages to other brokers, check the validity of the topic and make sure it does not have topic wildcards [#9291](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9291).

- Disable authorization for `api/v4/emqx_prometheus` endpoint on management api listener (default 8081) [#9294](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9294).

## 4.3.21

*Release Date: 2022-09-14*

### Enhancements

- TLS listener memory usage optimization [#9005](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9005).
  New config `listener.ssl.$NAME.hibernate_after` to hibernate TLS connection process after idling.
  Hibernation can reduce RAM usage significantly, but may cost more CPU.
  This configuration is by default disabled.
  Our preliminary test shows a 50% of RAM usage decline when configured to '5s'.

- TLS listener default buffer size to 4KB [#9007](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9007)
  Eliminate uncertainty that the buffer size is set by OS default.

- Disable authorization for `api/v4/emqx_prometheus` endpoint [#8955](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8955).

- Added a test to prevent a last will testament message to be
  published when a client is denied connection [#8894](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8894).

- More rigorous checking of flapping to improve stability of the system [#9045](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9045).

- QoS1 and QoS2 messages in session's buffer are re-dispatched to other members in the group
  when the session terminates [#9094](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9094).
  Prior to this enhancement, one would have to set `broker.shared_dispatch_ack_enabled` to `true`
  to prevent sessions from buffering messages, however this acknowledgement costs extra resources.

- Fix delayed publish timing inaccuracy caused by OS time change [#8908](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8908).

### Bug fixes

- Fix HTTP client library to handle SSL socket passive signal [#9145](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9145).

- Hide redis password in error logs [#9071](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9071)
  In this change, it also included more changes in redis client:
  - Improve redis connection error logging [eredis#19](https://github.com/emqx/eredis/pull/19).
    Also added support for eredis to accept an anonymous function as password instead of
    passing around plaintext args which may get dumpped to crash logs (hard to predict where).
    This change also added `format_status` callback for `gen_server` states which hold plaintext
    password so the process termination log and `sys:get_status` will print '******' instead of
    the password to console.
  - Avoid pool name clashing [eredis_cluster#22](https://github.com/emqx/eredis_cluster/pull/22).
    Same `format_status` callback is added here too for `gen_server`s which hold password in
    their state.

- Fix shared subscription message re-dispatches [#9094](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9094).
  - When discarding QoS 2 inflight messages, there were excessive logs
  - For wildcard deliveries, the re-dispatch used the wrong topic (the publishing topic,
    but not the subscribing topic), caused messages to be lost when dispatching.

- Fix shared subscription group member unsubscribe issue when 'sticky' strategy is used.
  Prior to this fix, if a previously picked member unsubscribes from the group (without reconnect)
  the message is still dispatched to it.
  This issue only occurs when unsubscribe with the session kept.
  Fixed in [#9119](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9119)

- Fix shared subscription 'sticky' strategy when there is no local subscriptions at all.
  Prior to this change, it may take a few rounds to randomly pick group members until a local subscriber
  is hit (and then start sticking to it).
  After this fix, it will start sticking to whichever randomly picked member even when it is a
  subscriber from another node in the cluster.
  Fixed in [#9122](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9122)

- Fix rule engine fallback actions metrics reset [#9125](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9125).
