## 6.0.0

*Release Date: 2025-09-*

Make sure to check the breaking changes and known issues before upgrading to EMQX 6.0.0.

### Feature Highlights

- **Major Version Release**: EMQX Enterprise 6.0.0 is the first release of the EMQX Enterprise version 6 series, bringing significant architectural improvements and new capabilities.
- **Enhanced AWS Integration**: Support for Instance Metadata Service v2 APIs from EC2 instances when using S3 or S3Tables data integration. This enables seamless access to S3 buckets without manual AWS credential configuration, leveraging IAM roles for better security.
- **Elixir Support**: All packages now ship with Elixir support through the Mix build system, opening EMQX to the Elixir community and enabling better tooling with IEx console.
- **New Data Integrations**:
  - BigQuery Connector and Action for appending data to Google BigQuery
  - Snowpipe Streaming upload mode for Snowflake Action (preview feature)
  - Parquet format support for S3Tables Action
- **Durable Storage Optimizations**: Significant RAM usage and storage efficiency improvements with new RocksDB configuration options and ASN1 serialization schema as default.
- **Enhanced LDAP Support**: LDAP authorization now supports extended ACL rules in JSON format, and LDAP authentication can fetch ACL rules directly from LDAP with client-side caching.
- **Improved Tracing**: Configurable limits for maximum traces (`trace.max_traces`) and trace file sizes (`trace.max_file_size`), with optimized implementation to prevent atom leaks.
- **Cluster Management**: New `cluster.description` configuration option allows users to set and display custom cluster descriptions in the EMQX Dashboard.

### Enhancements

#### Message Queue

- [#15789](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15789) Implemented Message Queues, which are collections of messages identified by `topic/filter`. Each queue has an explicit lifecycle and is automatically replenished with published messages matched with the queue's topic filter during the queue's lifetime.
  Clients can cooperatively consume messages from a queue by subscribing to a special topic in the format: `$q/topic/filter`.

#### Core MQTT Functionalities

- [#15805](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15805) Introduced a dedicated worker pool for handling sharded fanout message delivery.
  Previously, the broker pool handled both subscription management and message dispatch, which could lead to scheduling contention. This change separates the fanout dispatch workload into its own pool to ensure more balanced and efficient handling of pub/sub operations.

#### Access Control

- [#15349](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15349) Optimize external resource management for authentication and authorization. Previously, EMQX could remain connected to a resource configured for a disabled authenticator or authorizer.

- [#15294](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15294) Enhanced LDAP authentication and authorization. LDAP authorization now supports extended ACL rules in JSON format. LDAP authentication can now fetch ACL rules from LDAP. These rules are cached in the client's metadata, so authorization is performed without additional LDAP queries.

- [#15730](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15730) Added support for overriding the client ID based on authentication results. If an authentication backend returns a `clientid_override` attribute upon successful authentication, it will replace the client’s original client ID.

  The following backends now support `clientid_override`:

  - HTTP
  - JWT
  - LDAP
  - MongoDB
  - MySQL
  - Postgres
  - Redis

- [#15820](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15820) Changed default value of config `authorization.no_match` from `allow` to `deny` for better security defaults.

#### Clustering

- [#15600](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15600) Introduced a new configuration option `cluster.description` that allows you to add a descriptive label to the EMQX cluster.  This description can be updated via `PUT /cluster`, and retrieved with the `GET /cluster` API.

#### LLM-Based MQTT Data Processing

- [#15467](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15467) Exposed transport configuration options for AI Completion Providers. Users can now configure connection timeouts and the maximum number of connections to AI Completion Providers. This helps prevent `checkout_timeout` errors when message throughput is high and the provider is under load.
- Flow designer supports integrating with the [Google Gemini model](https://docs.mqttce.com/en/emqx/v6.0/flow-designer/gemini-node-quick-start.html).

- [#15631](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15631) Added a new API endpoint to list all models available for an AI provider.
- [#15467](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15467) Exposed transport options for AI Completion Providers. These options allow configuring connection timeouts and maximum connections to an AI Completion Provider.
- [#15724](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15724) Introduced `openai_response` type for AI Completion Providers and completion profiles to use OpenAI's `response` API.

#### Data Integration

- [#15418](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15418) EMQX supports data integration with [BigQuery](https://docs.mqttce.com/en/emqx/v6.0/data-integration/bigquery.html). 

- [#15401](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15401) Added support for the Snowpipe Streaming upload mode in the [Snowflake Action](https://docs.mqttce.com/en/emqx/v6.0/data-integration/snowflake.html#create-a-rule-with-snowflake-sink).
  *Note: Snowpipe Streaming is currently a* [*preview feature*](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/preview-features) *and is only available for Snowflake accounts hosted on AWS.*

- [#15387](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15387) Added rate limiting to Kinesis Producer Connector and Action health checks to comply with AWS API quotas and improve cluster behavior.

  - Health check calls to `ListStreams` and `DescribeStream` are now limited to 5/s and 10/s per Connector, respectively, matching AWS rate limits.
  - A distributed limiter is coordinated by a core node in the cluster to enforce these limits consistently.
  - If a health check is throttled or times out, the Connector or Action will now retain its previous status instead of being marked as disconnected.

  Also introduced a new `resource_opts.health_check_interval_jitter`, which adds a uniform random delay to `resource_opts.health_check_interval` to reduce the chance of multiple Actions under the same Connector running health checks at the same time.

- [#15371](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15371) Added `tags` fields to the responses of `GET /actions_summary` and to the `fallback_actions` section returned by `GET /actions/:id`. This improves consistency and allows clients to retrieve tag metadata for actions and fallback actions.

- [#15360](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15360) Added support for writing data files in Parquet format in the S3 Tables Action.

- [#15176](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15176) Upgraded the GreptimeDB Connector client and supported an optional new parameter `ttl` to set the default time-to-live for automatically created tables.

- [#15649](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15649) EMQX supports data integration with [AWS AlloyDB](https://docs.mqttce.com/en/emqx/v6.0/data-integration/alloydb.html), [CockroachDB](https://docs.mqttce.com/en/emqx/v6.0/data-integration/cockroachdb.html) and [AWS Redshift](https://docs.mqttce.com/en/emqx/v6.0/data-integration/redshift.html).

- [#15635](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15635) Added new `key` and `tag` template fields in the [RocketMQ Action](https://docs.mqttce.com/en/emqx/v6.0/data-integration/data-bridge-rocketmq.html#create-a-rule-with-rocketmq-sink-for-message-storage), allowing customization of the message's key and tag. Also, introduced a new `key_dispatch` option for the `Produce Strategy` field. 

- [#15621](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15621) Now, `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` are optional fields for the S3Tables Connector.  If omitted, they'll be obtained from the Instance Metadata Service v2 APIs from the EC2 instance where EMQX is deployed.

- [#15542](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15542) Upgraded our `erlcoud` library to `3.8.3.0`.  This allows users to set up an [S3 Connector](https://docs.mqttce.com/en/emqx/v6.0/data-integration/s3.html#create-a-connector) without specifying Access Key Id and Secret Access Key, so long as the EC2 instance EMQX is running in has the correct IAM permissions to read/write to the configured bucket(s).

- [#15583](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15583) [#15585](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15585) Updated the `brod` client to version 4.4.4, expanding support for a wider range of Kafka APIs. This update addresses the deprecation of `JoinGroups` API versions `v0 `-`v1`.

- [#15628](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15628) Removed HStreamDB data integration.

- [#15544](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15544) Added Arrow Flight SQL NIF driver support for Datalayers Integration.

- [#15637](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15637) Added support for templating message headers and properties for the RabbitMQ Action.

- [#15864](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15864) Removed the deprecated "Bridges V1" APIs and configuration schemas. All endpoints under `/bridges/*` and configuration entries under the `bridges` root key are no longer available, as data integrations have fully migrated to the "Connectors/Actions/Sources" model.

#### Smart Data Hub

- [#15525](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15525) Prevented deletion of internal schemas that are still in use. If a schema is referenced by a Schema Validation or Message Transformation, it can no longer be removed to avoid runtime errors and configuration inconsistencies.

#### Durable Storage

- [#15463](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15463) Improved durable storage RAM usage and storage efficiency.
  - Introduced the following configuration parameters for the durable storage to improve control over RocksDB memory usage and storage performance:
    - `durable_storage.messages.rocksdb.write_buffer_size`: RocksDB memtable size per shard.
    - `durable_storage.messages.rocksdb.cache_size`: RocksDB block size per shard.
    - `durable_storage.messages.rocksdb.max_open_files`: Limits the number of file descriptors used by RocksDB per shard.
    - `durable_storage.messages.layout.wildcard_thresholds`: Allows to tune wildcard thresholds for the `wildcard_optimized_v2` storage layout.
  - Additionally, the default `serialization_schema` for stored messages has been changed to `asn1`.

#### CLI

- [#15399](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15399) The `node_dump` tool now exports the current system configuration in HOCON format, with sensitive information (such as passwords and secrets) automatically redacted for security.

#### Namespace

- [#15841](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15841) Improved the refresh rate of the session count for namespaced sessions.

  - If a namespace has fewer than 1000 connections, its session count is now updated on demand.
  - For namespaces with 1000 or more connections, the count is updated every 5 seconds.

  During a rolling upgrade from versions prior to 6.0, session counts may appear inconsistent due to changes in the internal tracking tables. This is expected: as clients reconnect to upgraded nodes, the session counts will gradually stabilize and become accurate once all nodes are running version 6.0 or later.

#### Observability

- [#15594](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15594) Introduced a new configuration option `trace.max_traces` to control the maximum number of active cluster-wide traces. This limit does not apply to node-local traces managed using `emqx ctl trace`.

  This update also optimized tracing implementation to eliminate potential atom leaks per created trace.

- [#15556](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15556) Introduced a new configuration option `trace.max_file_size` to limit the maximum file size for each individual trace.

- [#15650](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15650) Implemented automatic trace log rotation.

  When a trace file size exceeds `trace.max_file_size`, EMQX no longer discards all subsequent events and emits an incomprehensible warning to `stderr`. Instead, portions of the oldest events are discarded while the most recent ones are retained.

  As such, this also implies that:

  * EMQX now maintains multiple trace log files per active trace. The layout of the trace directory has changed accordingly.
  * Trace API has been updated to reflect this behavior. The Log Stream API may return new errors, such as when a stream becomes stale due to a slow consumer.


- [#15904](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15904) Support viewing and updating of tracing configuration through Trace API.

#### Performance

- [#15536](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15536) Disabled the `node.global_gc_interval` configuration by default to improve overall performance stability, as it caused CPU fluctuations and higher message latency while providing little benefit over Erlang’s built-in garbage collector. also in 5.8.8 
- [#15539](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15539) Optimized Erlang VM parameters to improve performance and stability:
  - Increased buffer size for distributed channels to 32 MB (`+zdbbl 32768`) to prevent `busy_dist_port` alarms during intensive Mnesia operations.
  - Disabled scheduler busy-waiting (`+sbwt none +sbwtdcpu none +sbwtdio none`) to lower CPU usage reported by the operating system.
  - Set scheduler binding type to `db` (`+stbt db`) to reduce message latency. Also in 5.8.8 
- [#15451](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15451) Introduced an experimental `socket` backend for TCP listeners, aimed at improving message processing latency and reducing compute resource usage. The feature can be enabled with the new `tcp_backend` listener option.

#### Build and Tooling

- [#15484](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15484) Switched the build system to [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)'s [Mix](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/introduction-to-mix.html), enabling all packages to include native Elixir support. This change improves developer tooling, allows integration with Elixir dependencies when needed, and enables use of the [IEx](https://hexdocs.pm/iex/IEx.html) shell as a more powerful EMQX console.

#### License

- [#15921](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15921) Introduced a license alarm for cluster-wide maximum transactions per second (TPS).
  - Each node calculates TPS as the average number of MQTT messages sent and received over the past 10 seconds.
  - The total cluster TPS is aggregated every 5 seconds.
  - If the observed TPS exceeds the licensed limit, an alarm is triggered.
  - The alarm remains active until a license with a higher TPS allowance is applied.

#### MQTT over QUIC

- [#15997](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15997) Added support for disabling QUIC stack loading by setting the environment variable `QUICER_SKIP_NIF_LOAD=1.`

### Bug Fixes

#### Core MQTT Functionalities

- [#15396](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15396) Removed redundant cleanup operations for shared subscriptions of disconnected clients. These operations were prone to crashes under high disconnect volumes and could lead to inconsistencies in the global broker state.
- [#15361](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15361) Fixed a `function_clause` error when parsing a malformed `User-Property` pair with invalid (too short) length.
- [#15416](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15416) Fixed occasional warning-level log events and crashes during session expiration of WebSocket connections. This issue was introduced by recent WebSocket performance improvements. If did not affect broker capacity, but produced log entries like the following:
  - `error: {function_clause,[{gen_tcp,send,[closed,[]],[{file,“gen_tcp.erl”},{line,966}]},{cowboy_websocket_linger,commands,3,[{file,“cowboy_websocket_linger.erl”},{line,665}]},...`
  - `message: {tcp,#Port<0.364>,<<136,130,...>>}, msg: emqx_session_mem_unknown_message`

#### Deployment

- [#15580](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15580) Added a new `emqxLicenseSecretRef` variable to the EMQX Enterprise Helm chart. This allows users to specify a Kubernetes Secret containing the EMQX license key, so the license is applied automatically.

  This replaces the non-functional `emqxLicenseSecretName` variable, which created and mounted a secret file but did not pass the license to EMQX.

- [#15553](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15553) Fixed an issue in the Helm chart where deploying EMQX with default values started multiple replicas and caused all nodes except one to crash. The chart now defaults to a single replica, since clustered deployments require an Commercial License.

#### Security

- [#15581](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15581) Upgraded Erlang/OTP version from 26.2.5.2 to 26.2.5.14. This upgrade includes two TLS-related fixes from OTP that affect EMQX:
  - Fixed a crash in TLS connections caused by a race condition during certificate renewal.
  - Added support for RSA certificates signed with RSASSA-PSS parameters. Previously, such certificates could cause TLS handshakes to fail with a `bad_certificate` / `invalid_signature` error.

#### Access Control

- [#15489](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15489) Fixed OIDC issuer URL validation in Single Sign-On (SSO) settings. Previously, issuer URLs containing a port number (for example,
  `https://xxxxxxxx:8443/webman/sso/.well-known/openid-configuration`) were rejected with a `bad_port_number` error. These URLs are now supported.

#### Clustering

- [#15518](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15518) Resolved a race condition that could cause accumulating inconsistencies in the routing table and shared subscription state in the cluster when a large number of shared subscribers disconnect simultaneously.

#### Rule Engine

- [#15569](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15569) Fixed an issue where a Republish Rule Action could fail if the `direct_dispatch` template was empty or resolved to a non-boolean value. In these cases, the default value `false` is now used.

#### Data Integration

- [#15522](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15522) Fixed an issue where Snowflake Connector would fail to start correctly if `username` was not provided.
- [#15476](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15476) Fixed a missing callback in `emqx_connector_aggreg_delivery` that caused a crash when formatting delivery process status for aggregated-mode Actions (e.g., Azure Blob Storage, Snowflake, S3 Tables).
  This occurred during failures or when inspecting delivery processes with `gen_server:format_status/1`. The issue is now resolved, and more detailed delivery status information will be logged.
- [#15394](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15394) Fixed a rare race condition where Action metrics could become inconsistent due to unexpected asynchronous replies.
- [#15647](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15647) Fixed an issue where a MongoDB Connector was marked as `Disconnected` if the MongoDB account specified in the connector configuration lacked privileges to perform `find` queries on the `foo` collection.
- [#15603](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15603) Fixed an issue in the MQTT bridge where a stale connection could be shown as `Connected` and would not automatically reconnect.
- [#15383](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15383) Fixed a potential resource leak in MQTT bridge. When a bridge failed to start, the topic index table was not properly cleaned up.
- [#15786](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15786) Fixed a potential atom leak when probing RocketMQ Connectors.
- [#15806](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15806) Improved validation for Oracle Actions during creation. Previously, in rare cases, an Action containing an invalid SQL statement could be added successfully.
- [#15848](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15848) Improved error reporting for the Oracle Connector. When the connector becomes disconnected, its status now includes a more specific reason, making diagnostics easier.

#### Smart Data Hub

- [#15839](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15839) Fixed an encoding issue with Protobuf schemas that use `map<_, _>` fields.
  Previously, schemas containing `map<string, string>` fields could fail to encode valid payloads, resulting in cryptic runtime errors.

  Example schema:

  ```protobuf
  syntax = "proto3";
  
  message test {
  map<string, string> args = 1;
  }
  ```

  Example rule:

  ```sql
  SELECT
  schema_encode('xxx', json_decode(payload), 'test') as protobuf_test
  FROM
  "t/#"
  ```

  Example payload failed to be encoded:

  ```json
  {
  "args": {
  "env": "stag"
  }
  }
  ```

  Previous error similar to:

  ```
  2025-06-17T06:59:22.725785+00:00 [warning] tag: RULE_SQL_EXEC, clientid: c_emqx, msg: SELECT_clause_exception, reason: {error,{gpb_type_error,{bad_unicode_string,[{value,env},{path,"test.args.key"}]}},[{'$schema_parser_xxx',mk_type_error,3,[{file,"$schema_parser_xxx.erl"},{line,437}]},{'$schema_parser_xxx','-v_map<string,string>/3-lc$^0/1-0-',3,[{file,"$schema_parser_xxx.erl"},{line,429}]},{'$schema_parser_xxx','v_map<string,string>',3,[{file,"$schema_parser_xxx.erl"},{line,429}]},{'$schema_parser_xxx',v_msg_test,3,[{file,"$schema_parser_xxx.erl"},{line,404}]},{'$schema_parser_xxx',encode_msg,3,[{file,"$schema_parser_xxx.erl"},{line,73}]},{emqx_schema_registry_serde,with_serde,2,[{file,"emqx_schema_registry_serde.erl"},{line,212}]}...
  ```

#### Observability

- [#15931](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15931) Fixed two issues related to the EMQX alarm system:

  - Resolved a bug where spurious but harmless error logs could appear during node startup, such as:

    ```
    [error] Generic event handler emqx_alarm_handler crashed ...
    Reason: {aborted,{no_exists,[emqx_activated_alarm,runq_overload]}}
    ```

  - Fixed a bug where an alarm activation timeout could crash the connection process under certain conditions.

#### Gateway

- [#15342](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15342) Fixed a crash in the NATS gateway caused by client info override templates referencing undefined packet fields. The system now returns an empty binary instead of undefined atom.

#### MQTT over QUIC

- [#15614](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15614) QUIC Listener: When TLS key logging (`SSLKEYLOGFILE`) is enabled, EMQX now dumps TLS keys even if the handshake fails.

#### Cluster Linking

- [#15894](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15894) Previously, when listing all cluster links via `GET /cluster/links`, disabled links would be returned having an `inconsistent` status. Now they are returned as `disconnected`.

#### Performance

- [#15696](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15696) Added connection rate limiting support for WebSocket (WS) and WebSocket Secure (WSS) listeners.
  The `max_conn_rate` and `max_conn_burst` configuration options are now enforced: incoming connections exceeding the defined rate are immediately closed upon acceptance, consistent with existing TCP listener behavior.

  Additionally, the behavior of `max_connections` has been updated. When the connection limit is exceeded, WS/WSS listeners now close connections immediately before any HTTP handshake, resulting in an abrupt socket close instead of returning an HTTP 429 response.

- [#15854](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15854) Reduced the default `active_n` value from `100` to `10` to improve MQTT client responsiveness, especially under high message rates with small payloads.

  The lower `active_n` introduces more backpressure at the TCP layer, stricter than the default `Receive-Maximum` of `32`, which helps in the following scenarios:

  - The client process is blocked by external authorization checks
  - Data integration operations are delaying message handling
  - The system is under heavy load or nearing resource limits

- [#15981](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15981) Prevented excessive memory growth caused by Mnesia transaction blocking during cleanup of large volumes of audit logs. This improves system stability and memory efficiency during heavy audit log maintenance operations.
