# EMQX Enterprise Version 6

## 6.1.0

*Release Date: 2025-12-30*

Make sure to check the breaking changes and known issues before upgrading to EMQX 6.1.0.

### Feature Highlights

EMQX 6.1.0 introduces MQTT Streams, enhanced namespace capabilities, new data integrations, and centralized certificate management.

**MQTT Streams**

MQTT Streams feature provide durable collections of messages identified by a topic filter, with explicit lifecycle management. Messages matching a stream's topic filter are automatically appended, enabling consumption with ordering guarantees and support for multiple consumers. Clients can subscribe to streams using the special topic format `$s/<timestamp>/topic/filter` to consume messages from a specific point in time.


**Enhanced Namespace Capabilities**

- Configurations for namespace and isolation settings are now grouped together in the dashboard.
- Expanded namespace functionality with namespaced metrics, authentication, and authorization.
- Namespaced metrics are now available for messages, sessions, and data integration operations, exposed via Prometheus endpoints.
- Built-in authentication and authorization backends now support namespace-specific users and rules, enabling better multi-tenant isolation.
- Added automatic topic isolation using client namespaces as mountpoints.

**New Data Integrations**

- AWS Timestream for InfluxDB connector
- EMQX Tables connector
- InfluxDB API v3 support for InfluxDB and AWS Timestream connectors
- OAuth authentication for Kafka and Confluent Producer connectors
- Parquet file support for Azure Blob Storage and S3 Actions in Aggregated mode

**Certificate Management**

Added centralized certificate management via HTTP API, allowing certificates to be managed independently and referenced in SSL options for listeners and connectors.

### Enhancements

#### Message Queue and MQTT Stream

- [#16326](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16326) Implemented MQTT Streams.

  MQTT Streams are durable collections of messages identified by a topic filter.
  They have an explicit lifecycle, and any published message that matches the Stream's topic filter is automatically appended to the stream.
  Streams allow consumption of messages with ordering guarantees and can be consumed multiple times.
  To consume messages from a stream, clients can subscribe to a special topic of the form
  `$s/<timestamp>/topic/filter`, where `topic/filter` refers to an existing stream. Subscribing with a timestamp allows consumption to begin at a specific point in time. The timestamp may be a Unix timestamp in microseconds or one of two special values: `earliest` or `latest`.

- [#16454](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16454) For Message Queues and MQTT Streams, reconfigured garbage collection interval is now applied immediately. Previously, the new interval was applied only after the next garbage collection cycle.

#### Core MQTT Functionalities

- [#16099](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16099) Added a new rule engine event: `$events/client/ping`. This is triggered when a client sends a `PINGREQ` packet.

#### Access Control

- [#16132](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16132) Added an HTTP API to manage certificates in a centralized manner.

- [#16154](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16154) Added support for referencing managed certificate files in SSL options of listeners and clients.

- [#16266](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16266) Added a new `authorization.include_mountpoint` configuration. When enabled, topics will be prefixed by the listener's mountpoint before being evaluated by authorization backends.

- [#16272](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16272) Added support for specifying namespaced rules when using the built-in authorization backend.  Now, MQTT clients that belong to a namespace will consider only their namespaced rules when authorizing actions.

- [#16345](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16345) Added support for specifying namespaced users when using the built-in authentication backend. Now, MQTT clients that belong to a namespace will consider only their namespaced data when authenticating.

#### Data Integration

- [#15905](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15905) Now, for the HTTP Action, the HTTP request timeout is taken to be the same as `resource_opts.request_ttl`.  Previously, it was a fixed, non-configurable value of 30 seconds.

- [#16169](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16169) Updated our `parquer` dependency to support encoding `timestamp` Iceberg types to Parquet files.

- [#16179](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16179) Added support for writing Parquet files when using the Aggregated mode in Azure Blob Storage and S3 Actions.

- [#16267](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16267) EMQX supports data integration with AWS Timestream for InfluxDB.

- [#16290](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16290) Added support for OAuth authentication when using Kafka and Confluent Producer Connectors.

- [#16316](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16316) Changed the default batch size and time for multiple actions. Actions that previously supported batch operations had their defaults increased, so that now batching is the default behavior for them.

- [#16372](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16372) Added support for InfluxDB API v3 to InfluxDB and AWS Timestream Connectors.

- [#16396](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16396) EMQX supports data integration with EMQX Tables.

#### Durable Storage

- [#16136](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16136) Improved resource management and performance for durable storage.

  Introduced a concept of durable storage database group. Certain resources (such as memtable size and disk usage quota) can be shared between the group members.

  Added the following new metrics (per DB group):

  - `emqx_ds_disk_usage`: Total size of SST files
  - `emqx_ds_write_buffer_memory_usage`: RocksDB memtable size
  - `emqx_ds_total_trash_size`: Disk usage by trash SST files

  Added the following group configurations:

  - `durable_storage.db_groups.<group>.storage_quota`: Soft quota for the SST files size
  - `durable_storage.db_groups.<group>.write_buffer_size`: Maximum memtable size
  - `durable_storage.db_groups.<group>.rocksdb_nthreads_high` and `durable_storage.db_groups.<group>.rocksdb_nthreads_low`: Size of RocksDB thread pools.

  Added a new alarm that is raised when the quota is exceeded: `db_storage_quota_exceeded:<DB>`. Please refer to the "Storage Quota" section of the documentation for more details.

  Default session checkpoint interval has been changed to 15s.

- [#16286](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16286) Optimized the default durable storage settings to reduce CPU load. This PR disables subscriptions for DBs that don't use them.

#### Namespace

- [#16211](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16211) Added initial support for namespaced metrics.

  - Messages received
  - Count
  - Bytes
  - Messages sent
  - Count
  - Bytes
  - Number of sessions
  - Data integration
  - Number of actions triggered
  - DB records
  - Number of AuthN records
  - Number of AuthZ records

  Clients in managed namespaces will bump the namespaced metrics above, as well as continue to bump the usual global metrics.

  These metrics are exposed in Prometheus format to be scraped from the `GET /prometheus/ns/stats` endpoint.  By specifying the `ns=NAMESPACE` query parameter, only data from `NAMESPACE` will be returned. Omitting this parameter causes data from all namespaces to be scraped. Namespaces are added as labels to metrics.

- [#16314](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16314) Now, global admin users will see resources from all namespaces (by default) when listing namespaced resources (connectors/sources/actions/rules). They may focus on one particular namespace when performing CRUD operations by passing the `ns=NS` query parameter. If they want to list only the global namespace resources, they omit `ns` and pass `only_global=true` query parameter. Namespaced resources now return the `namespace` field to denote where they come from, with `namespace` being `null` for global resources to distinguish them from a potential namespace called `"global"`.

- [#16360](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16360) Added a `GET /mt/ns/:ns/metrics` endpoint that will return namespace-specific metrics in JSON format.

- [#16472](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16472) Added a new configuration option `namespace_as_mountpoint` to enable automatic topic isolation using client namespaces.

  When enabled, EMQX uses the client's namespace (from `client_attrs.tns`) as a topic mountpoint if no mountpoint is configured on the listener.

  Topics are automatically prefixed with the namespace for PUBLISH, SUBSCRIBE, UNSUBSCRIBE, and Will messages, and the prefix is stripped when delivering messages to clients.

  This setting is ignored if the listener already has a mountpoint configured, ensuring existing configurations take precedence.

#### Observability

- [#16135](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16135) Added two new metrics and corresponding rates for the `GET /monitor_current` HTTP API: `rules_matched` and `actions_executed`.  They track the number of rules that matched and action execution rate (i.e., success + failure), respectively.

- [#16213](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16213) Added MQTT client ID as a process label so crash logs (including max-heap and force-shutdown errors) now include the client ID for easier troubleshooting.

#### Performance

- [#16368](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16368) Upgraded the underlying runtime system from Erlang/OTP 27 to Erlang/OTP 28.

- [#16377](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16377) Reduced the number of pre-allocated metrics counters, which should contribute to reduced memory usage, especially in clusters using lots of namespaces.

#### MQTT over QUIC

- [#16133](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16133) MQTT over QUIC: Added support for connection probing using datagrams. 

  EMQX now supports zero-length datagram packets sent by clients to test connectivity. Clients can also send non-zero-length datagram packets, but they will be ignored by EMQX.

### Bug Fixes

#### Core MQTT Functionalities

- [#16344](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16344) Fixed a crash in MQTT v5 connections caused by a type mismatch when processing the request-response-information property.

- [#16354](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16354) Backported the MQTT v5 `request-response-information` schema type fix to the 6.0.x release line.

#### Access Control

- [#16308](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16308) Fixed an issue where Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) could not be enabled after upgrading EMQX from versions earlier than 5.3.0 due to incompatible login-user database records.

- [#16446](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16446) Fixed an issue with authenticator metrics when using SCRAM in which the 'Total' count would be incremented twice for each authentication attempt, and the 'Success' count would not be bumped.

#### Data Integration

- [#16265](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16265) The health check now verifies leader connectivity only for the partitions assigned to the current EMQX node, preventing unnecessary idle connections and false alarms.

  Previously, the Kafka source connector checked leader connectivity for all partitions. In clustered deployments, each node owns only a subset of partitions, leaving connections to unassigned partition leaders idle. Because Kafka closes idle connections after a timeout (10 minutes by default), this could result in false connectivity alarms.

- [#16352](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16352) Upgraded Apache Pulsar client to 2.1.2. When Pulsar producer action's `batch_size` is configured to `1`, the producer will now encode single messages instead of single-element batch. This should allow consumers to share load using Key Share strategy.

- [#16383](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16383) Previously, when using IoTDB Connector with its RestAPI driver, credentials would not be checked during health checks.  Now, we send a no-op query during IoTDB connector health-check. This enables early detection of misconfigured client credentials.

#### Message Queue

- [#16270](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16270) Fixed a shutdown handling issue in the EMQX message queue consumer.

#### Clustering

- [#16453](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16453) Upgraded `gen_rpc` to `3.5.1`. 

  Prior to the `gen_rpc` upgrade, EMQX may experience long tail of crash logs due to connect timeout if a peer node is unreachable. The new version `gen_rpc` no longer has the long tail and converted crash logs to more readable `error` logs,
  and the frequent log `"failed_to_connect_server"` is also throttled to avoid spamming.

#### Cluster Linking

- [#16269](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16269) Fixed an issue in the Cluster Link route replication protocol recovery sequence where re-bootstrapping was incorrectly skipped even though the remote side needed it.

- [#16317](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16317) Fixed an issue in Cluster Link garbage-collection logic that could accidentally remove live routes from the internal routing table in the process of cleaning up stale route replication state. This problem occurred only when multiple independent Cluster Links were set up, and some of these links went down for relatively long periods of time.

#### Observability

- [#16417](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16417) Reduced the volume of logs generated when a resource exception occurs (`resource_exception`).  These logs are now throttled, and some potentially large terms are redacted from them.

- [#16434](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16434) Now, clearing an alarm name will clear it from all nodes. Previously, using the HTTP API to force deactivate an alarm would not clear it from all nodes. 

#### Gateway

- [#16425](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16425) Improved the returned errors when creating or updating a Gateway via the HTTP API.

#### Miscellaneous

- [#16397](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16397) Added TLS certificate validation before listener start. Fail-fast if listener is misconfigured with invalid certificates.

- [#16311](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16311) Updated error codes to correct terminology from misspelled `REST_FAILED` to `RESET_FAILED`.

## 6.0.2

*Release Date: 2026-01-16*

Make sure to check the breaking changes and known issues before upgrading to EMQX 6.0.2.

### Enhancements

#### Security

- [#16461](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16461) EMQX now supports TLS 1.3 session resumption using stateless session tickets, allowing clients to resume TLS connections without requiring server-side session state.

  **Configuration**

  - **Node-level**: `node.tls_stateless_tickets_seed`

    Secret key seed used to generate TLS 1.3 stateless session tickets.

  - **Listener-level**: `listeners.ssl.<name>.ssl_options.session_tickets`

    Enables TLS 1.3 session resumption. Supported values:

    - `disabled` (default)
    - `stateless`
    - `stateless_with_cert` (includes certificate information in the ticket)

  **Notes**

  - Session tickets are generated only when `node.tls_stateless_tickets_seed` is configured (non-empty), and `session_tickets` is enabled in listener SSL options.
  - If `session_tickets` is enabled but `node.tls_stateless_tickets_seed` is empty, session tickets will not be generated and an error log will be emitted when starting the listener.

  This PR also included a fix for the TLS 1.2 session resumption configuration. Previously, the `reuse_sessions` option for SSL listener did not take effect, i.e. EMQX always tried to enable TLS 1.2 session resumption. It is now possible to turn it off. Please note that TLS 1.2 session resumption will be disabled by default starting version 6.2.0.

#### Rule Engine

- [#16524](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16524) Enhanced base64 encoding and decoding functions in rule engine SQL with support for padding and URL-safe options.

  The `base64_encode` and `base64_decode` functions now support optional parameters to control encoding behavior:

  - **`no_padding`**: Encode or decode without padding characters (`=`). Useful when you need to remove padding from encoded strings or decode strings that do not have padding.
  - **`urlsafe`**: Use URL-safe base64 encoding/decoding. Replaces `+` with `-` and `/` with `_`, making the encoded string safe to use in URLs without encoding.

  These options can be used individually or combined in any order.

  **Examples in rule SQL:**

  Encode without padding:

  ```sql
  SELECT base64_encode(payload, 'no_padding') as encoded FROM "t/#"
  ```

  Encode with URL-safe characters:

  ```sql
  SELECT base64_encode(payload, 'urlsafe') as encoded FROM "t/#"
  ```

  Encode with both options (no padding and URL-safe):

  ```sql
  SELECT base64_encode(payload, 'no_padding', 'urlsafe') as encoded FROM "t/#"
  ```

  Decode URL-safe base64:

  ```sql
  SELECT base64_decode(payload, 'urlsafe') as decoded FROM "t/#"
  ```

  Decode unpadded URL-safe base64:

  ```sql
  SELECT base64_decode(payload, 'urlsafe', 'no_padding') as decoded FROM "t/#"
  ```

- [#16533](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16533) Added two new variadic expression helper functions, `json_value` and `jwt_value`, for extracting values from JSON data and JWT tokens using dot-separated key paths.

  - `json_value` extracts values from JSON binary strings by navigating nested objects with a dot-separated key path.
  - `jwt_value` decodes the payload of a JWT and extracts claim values using the same dot-separated path syntax.

  **Examples**:

  - If `username` contains a JSON object, you can access a nested field with `json_value(username, 'shop.floor')`.
  - If `password` contains a JWT with a customized claim, you can access a nested value with `jwt_value(password, 'client_attrs.unitid')`.

- [#16539](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16539) Added support for tracking Sparkplug B metric aliases when using the `spb_decode` Rule Engine function.

  After a device or Edge of Network (EoN) node publishes its `NBIRTH` or `DBIRTH` messages, EMQX records the alias-to-name mappings defined in those messages. When `spb_decode` is later applied to `NDATA` or `DDATA` messages from the same session, the original metric names are automatically restored and included in the decoded output.

  Note: when executing fallback actions, the mapping is not available in the environment where they run. This means that, if a fallback action republishes the undecoded `DDATA`/`NDATA` payload to a Sparkplug B `DDATA`/`NDATA` topic, the metric `name` fields will not be populated by the alias mapping.

#### Durable Storage

- [#16136](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16136) Improved resource management and performance for durable storage.

  Introduced a concept of a durable storage database group. Certain resources (such as memtable size and disk usage quota) can be shared between the group members.

  Added the following new metrics (per DB group):

  - `emqx_ds_disk_usage`: Total size of SST files
  - `emqx_ds_write_buffer_memory_usage`: RocksDB memtable size
  - `emqx_ds_total_trash_size`: Disk usage by trash SST files

  Added the following group configurations:

  - `durable_storage.db_groups.<group>.storage_quota`: Soft quota for the SST files size
  - `durable_storage.db_groups.<group>.write_buffer_size`: Maximum memtable size
  - `durable_storage.db_groups.<group>.rocksdb_nthreads_high` and `durable_storage.db_groups.<group>.rocksdb_nthreads_low`: Size of RocksDB thread pools.

  Added a new alarm that is raised when the quota is exceeded: `db_storage_quota_exceeded:<DB>`. Please refer to the "Storage Quota" section of the documentation for more details.

  Default session checkpoint interval has been changed to 15s.

- [#16286](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16286) Optimized the default durable storage settings to reduce CPU load. This PR disables subscriptions for DBs that don't use them.

#### Performance

- [#16413](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16413) Improved subscription handling performance by reducing redundant monitoring of MQTT session processes.

### Bug Fixes

#### Core MQTT Functionalities

- [#16354](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16354) Fixed a crash in MQTT v5 connections caused by a type mismatch when processing the request-response-information property.

- [#16515](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16515) Fixed an issue where WebSocket connections could crash when the broker sent messages exceeding the client-advertised `Maximum-Packet-Size`.

- [#16569](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16569) Fixed a rare race condition that could cause the supporting `emqx_flapping` process for flapping detection to crash under high system load.

#### Data Integration

- [#16265](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16265) The health check now verifies leader connectivity only for the partitions assigned to the current EMQX node, preventing unnecessary idle connections and false alarms.

  Previously, the Kafka source connector checked leader connectivity for all partitions. In clustered deployments, each node owns only a subset of partitions, leaving connections to unassigned partition leaders idle. Because Kafka closes idle connections after a timeout (10 minutes by default), this could result in false connectivity alarms.

- [#16542](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16542) Fixed an issue where Kafka producer connections could disconnect prematurely when Kafka was overloaded, leading to excessive produce request retries.

  The produce request timeout is now automatically set to at least twice the metadata request timeout, with a minimum of 30 seconds. This reduces unnecessary reconnections and retries when metadata requests take longer than expected, especially when the metadata request timeout is configured to a small value.

- [#16352](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16352) Upgraded Apache Pulsar client to 2.1.2. When Pulsar producer action's `batch_size` is configured to `1`, the producer will now encode single messages instead of single-element batch. This should allow consumers to share load using Key Share strategy.

- [#16383](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16383) Improved the IoTDB Connector health check when using the REST API driver.

  Previously, client credentials were not validated during health checks. The health check now sends a lightweight no-op query, allowing misconfigured credentials to be detected early.

- [#16507](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16507) Fixed an issue where an MQTT Source would stop receiving messages after its Connector reconnected.

  Previously, when an MQTT Source’s Connector recovered from a connection loss, its topics were not re-subscribed, causing the Source to stop working until the Connector was restarted. The Source now automatically re-subscribes upon reconnect.


#### Clustering

- [#16269](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16269) Fixed an issue in the Cluster Linking route replication protocol recovery sequence where re-bootstrapping was incorrectly skipped even though the remote side needed it.

- [#16317](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16317) Fixed an issue in Cluster Linking garbage-collection logic that could incorrectly remove active routes from the internal routing table while cleaning up stale route replication state.

  This issue could occur only in setups with multiple independent Cluster Links, where some links remained down for extended periods.

- [#16465](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16465) Upgraded `gen_rpc` to `3.5.1`.

  Before the `gen_rpc` upgrade, EMQX may experience a long tail of crash logs due to a connect timeout if a peer node is unreachable. The new version of gen_rpc no longer has the long tail and has converted crash logs to more readable error logs. Additionally, the frequent log `"failed_to_connect_server"` is also throttled to avoid spamming.

- [#16544](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16544) Improved the robustness of the cluster autoclean procedure. Previously, if the autoclean feature was disabled during the initial startup of a node, it would not be activated after subsequent configuration changes.

#### Upgrade

- [#16308](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16308) Fixed an issue where Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) could not be enabled after upgrading EMQX from versions earlier than 5.3.0 due to incompatible login-user database records.

#### Configuration Management

- [#16397](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16397) Added TLS certificate and key file validation before listener startup.

  EMQX now performs basic validation when parsing SSL listener configuration and emits error-level logs if invalid PEM files are detected (for example, `invalid_pem_file_ignored` and `bad_keyfile_ignored`). This makes troubleshooting easier as administrators can observe errors when starting/reconfiguring, instead of troubleshooting TLS handshake failures.

#### Access Control

- [#16423](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16423) Added support for verifying the JWT `aud` (audience) claim during authentication.

  When the `aud` claim is configured in `verify_claims`, the JWT must include a valid `aud` value. Both string and array formats are supported:

  - If `aud` is a string, it must exactly match the configured value.
  - If `aud` is an array, at least one element must match the configured value.
  - An empty string or empty array fails verification.
  - The verification also fails if the `aud` claim is missing when it is configured in `verify_claims`.

- [#16459](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16459) Fixed the issue in SCRAM authentication HTTP API. Previously, incorrect user ID was returned for the created user in the user creation API call.

#### Observability

- [#16417](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16417) Reduced log volume for `resource_exception` events. Logs generated when a resource exception occurs are now throttled, and potentially large terms are redacted to prevent excessive log output.

- [#16537](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16537) Fixed a formatter crash triggered by certain `gen_rpc` error messages.

  Previously, EMQX could crash with a “FORMATTER CRASH” error when `gen_rpc` logged specific errors (such as transmission timeouts). The formatter now safely handles these messages without crashing.

## 6.0.1

*Release Date: 2025-11-11*

Make sure to check the breaking changes and known issues before upgrading to EMQX 6.0.1.

### Enhancements

#### Message Queue

- [#16080](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16080) Added a configuration option to disable the Message Queues feature. Disabling Message Queues can slightly reduce the resource usage in the cluster. When Durable Sessions are also disabled, EMQX avoids maintaining Durable Storage, further reducing administrative overhead and improving performance.
- [#16096](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16096) Added support for automatic creation of message queues when clients subscribe to non-existent `$q/` topics. Now configuration options are available to enable auto-creation for both regular and last-value semantics queues.
- [#16097](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16097) Optimized message writing to regular message queues by replacing transactional appends with dirty append functions. For QoS 0 messages, asynchronous append operations are now used. These changes significantly improve the performance of message insertion into regular queues.
- [#16098](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16098) Added a maximum queue count configuration option to limit the total number of message queues in the system.
- [#16152](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16152) Introduced per-queue limits for maximum message count and total message size. Also added new metrics to monitor message append latency and help diagnose performance or queue-limiting issues.

#### Data Integration

- [#16121](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16121) Upgraded the GreptimeDB ingester client to [v0.2.3](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb-ingester-erl/releases/tag/v0.2.3), which fixes several bugs and introduces support for row-based gRPC protocol (the column-based protocol is now deprecated).

  Additionally, updated the CI image to the latest stable version of GreptimeDB.

- [#16127](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16127) Fixed an invalid string value issue in the GreptimeDB connector, following the changes introduced in [#16121](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16121).

#### Performance

- [#15949](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15949) Changed the default value of the `parse_unit` option in listener configuration from `chunk` to `frame`. This change can significantly reduce CPU usage when the payload size exceeds the socket buffer (default is 4 KB).

  **Note**: With `parse_unit = frame`, if a `PUBLISH` packet exceeds the maximum allowed size, EMQX will close the connection instead of sending a `DISCONNECT` packet.

- [#16165](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16165) Optimized the performance of the `GET /clients_v2` API. Previously, when the cluster had around 50,000 clients or more, API calls to retrieve the client list could be extremely slow or even time out.

### Bug Fixes

#### Core MQTT Functionalities

- [#15884](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15884) Resolve an issue where, in rare cases, the global routing table could indefinitely retain routing information for nodes that had long left the cluster.
- [#15518](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15518) Resolved a race condition that may lead to accumulating inconsistencies in the routing table and shared subscriptions state in the cluster when a large number of shared subscribers disconnect simultaneously.

#### Upgrade

- [#16047](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16047) Added support to perform rolling upgrade from EMQX Enterprise base version 5.8.0 and newer to 6.0. During the upgrade, legacy configurations are automatically migrated to the new format supported in 6.0. Specifically, the deprecated `bridges` configuration root is converted into the new `connectors`, `sources`, and `actions` roots.

  However, the GCP PubSub Consumer and Kafka Consumer sources will still require manual changes. If any source configuration still includes the deprecated `topic_mapping` field, it must be removed. Then, for each entry previously defined in `topic_mapping`, a separate "Source + Rule" pair must be created manually.


#### Security

- [#16156](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16156) Fixed an issue where some dependencies were missing default configurations compared to EMQX 5.10, potentially causing RSA signature verification failures. The missing defaults could lead to errors, such as the following log message:

  ```
  {sign_unsupported,[[{rsa_padding,rsa_pkcs1_padding}]]}, [{jose_jwa_unsupported,verify,5,[{file,"src/jwa/jose_jwa_unsupported.erl"},{line,55}]}
  ```

- [#16175](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16175) Fixed an issue with periodic TLS certificate garbage collection. Previously, the garbage collection process incorrectly deleted certificate files that were actively used by configurations in managed namespaces.

#### Access Control

- [#16081](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16081) Fixed an issue where clients using extended authentication and memory-based sessions could crash with a `session_stepdown_request_exception` caused by a `calling_self` error.

  ```

  </details>

#### Clustering

- [#16123](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16123) Fix a bug in the component managing Mria replication that could cause cluster joins to hang or remain incomplete in core-replicant clusters.

  During cluster changes involving adding new core nodes, those new core nodes could sometimes fail to start replication-related processes required by replicants. As a result, upgraded or newly added replicants could hang during startup.

  In Kubernetes deployments, this often caused readiness probes to fail, leading the controller to repeatedly restart the affected replicant pods.

  This issue typically affected upgrade rollouts involving the addition of new core and replicant nodes. For example, adding two cores and two replicants (running a newer EMQX version) to an existing cluster with 2 cores and 2 replicants.

#### Rule Engine

- [#16028](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16028) Fixed rule engine `jq` function memory leak.

  Previously if `jq` built-in function `index` is used (e.g. `.key | index("name")`), it would result in memory leak.

#### Data Integration

- [#16010](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16010) Fixed an issue where a Republish Fallback Action could fail with a `function_clause` error if the originating rule's SQL did not include the `metadata` field from the rule environment.

  Example error log:

  ```
  [error] tag: RESOURCE, msg: failed_to_trigger_fallback_action, reason: {error,function_clause}, fallback_kind: republish, primary_action_resource_id: <<"action:type:name:connector:type:name">>, republish_topic: <<"republish/topic">>
  ```

- [#16046](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16046) Fixed a potential out-of-memory (OOM) crash when loading or restarting a configuration containing a Connector with several hundred Actions.

- [#16140](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16140) Fix a Redis cluster failover issue that could cause the Connector to remain stuck in a "connecting" state.

  Previously, EMQX’s Redis cluster client only refreshed the cluster topology when regular queries (such as `GET`) failed. However, failures in periodic `PING` commands did not trigger a refresh. As a result, after a failover, the connector could continue using the outdated cluster topology if no other commands were issued, preventing recovery.

  With this fix, failed `PING` responses now trigger a cluster topology refresh, ensuring that the connector can detect failovers and recover promptly.

#### MQTT Durable Sessions

- [#16105](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16105) Durable storage performance optimization. In particular, this fix reduces the latency of `CONNACK` for clients using a durable session.
- [#16129](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16129) Durable storage transaction configuration can be changed in the runtime. Previously changing this configuration required a node restart.

#### Observability

- [#15963](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15963) Reduced excessive audit log entries generated during looped evaluations in the remote shell (`remsh`).

- [#15967](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15967) Fixed an issue where Mnesia transaction blocking during the cleanup of large volumes of audit logs could lead to rapid memory growth.

- [#16060](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16060) Fixed a logger formatter crash that could occur for some debug-level log messages containing deeply nested terms with non-ASCII characters.

  ```

  </details>

- [#16134](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16134) Fixed a backward compatibility issue that could prevent new Log Traces from being created in some cases.

#### Rate Limit

- [#16160](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16160) Improved the rate limiting algorithm for individual client connections. Previously, clients could temporarily exceed their publish rate limits, particularly just after connecting or after periods of inactivity.

  This update makes the limiter behavior more predictable and consistent, ensuring rate limits are correctly enforced from the start of a connection.

## 6.0.0

*Release Date: 2025-09-30*

Make sure to check the breaking changes and known issues before upgrading to EMQX 6.0.0.

### Feature Highlights

EMQX Enterprise 6.0.0 is the first release of the EMQX Enterprise version 6 series, bringing significant architectural improvements and new capabilities.

#### Message Queue

The native Message Queue feature unifies real-time MQTT publish/subscribe with persistent asynchronous queuing. The server buffers messages that match a topic filter, retaining them even when subscribers are offline. Clients can consume these messages through the special `$q/{topic}` topic, ensuring reliable message delivery.

Message Queues support offline message storage, last-value retention, and flexible dispatch strategies, enhancing MQTT with both real-time and durable messaging capabilities.

#### Namespace

The Namespace feature improves multi-tenancy and observability with namespace-level roles in the Dashboard. Users are restricted to their own resources (e.g., Rules, Actions, and Connectors) with fine-grained permissions such as Administrator or Viewer, and roles can be managed via the Dashboard, API, or CLI, simplifying multi-tenant operations.

Session count tracking has also been optimized: counts refresh on demand when there are fewer than 1,000 connections, and every 5 seconds otherwise. During rolling upgrades from older versions, counts may temporarily appear inconsistent, but will stabilize once all nodes are updated.

#### MQTT Durable Sessions

Durable storage has been optimized by separating session data from the broker’s other metadata, significantly reducing RAM usage and improving storage efficiency.

New configuration options provide finer control over RocksDB memory usage and performance. In addition, the default serialization schema for stored messages has been updated to ASN.1, further enhancing efficiency.

#### New Data Integrations

- Google BigQuery
- AWS AlloyDB
- CockroachDB
- AWS Redshift

#### Enhanced Integration

- **AWS**:
  - Support for Instance Metadata Service v2 APIs from EC2 instances when using S3 or S3Tables data integration. This enables seamless access to S3 buckets without manual AWS credential configuration, leveraging IAM roles for better security.
  - Parquet format support for S3 Tables Action.

- **RabbitMQ**: Define custom Headers and Properties Templates in RabbitMQ Sink to enhance message routing and compatibility within RabbitMQ.
- **Snowflake**: Snowpipe Streaming upload mode for Snowflake Action (preview feature).
- **RocketMQ**: New `key` and `tag` template fields in Action, along with a `key_dispatch` option for the Produce Strategy, allowing greater customization of message metadata.

#### Elixir Support

All packages now ship with Elixir support through the Mix build system, opening EMQX to the Elixir community and enabling better tooling with IEx console.

#### Enhanced LDAP Support

LDAP authorization now supports extended ACL rules in JSON format, and LDAP authentication can fetch ACL rules directly from LDAP with client-side caching.

#### Improved Tracing

Configurable limits for maximum traces (`trace.max_traces`) and trace file sizes (`trace.max_file_size`).
After `max_file_size` is reached, the trace log will rotate to a new file instead of halting.

#### Cluster Management

New `cluster.description` configuration option allows users to set and display custom cluster descriptions in the EMQX Dashboard.

### Enhancements

#### Message Queue

- [#15789](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15789) Implemented Message Queues, which are collections of messages identified by `topic_filter`. Each queue has an explicit lifecycle and is automatically replenished with published messages matched with the queue's topic filter during the queue's lifetime. Clients can cooperatively consume messages from a queue by subscribing to a special topic in the format: `$q/{topic}`.

#### Core MQTT Functionalities

- [#15805](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15805) Introduced a dedicated worker pool for handling sharded fanout message delivery.
  Previously, the broker pool handled both subscription management and message dispatch, which could lead to scheduling contention. This change separates the fanout dispatch workload into its own pool to ensure more balanced and efficient handling of pub/sub operations.

#### Access Control

- [#15349](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15349) Optimize external resource management for authentication and authorization. Previously, EMQX could remain connected to a resource configured for a disabled authenticator or authorizer.

- [#15294](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15294) Enhanced LDAP authentication and authorization. LDAP authorization now supports extended ACL rules in JSON format. LDAP authentication can now fetch ACL rules from LDAP. These rules are cached in the client's metadata, so authorization is performed without additional LDAP queries.

- [#15730](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15730) Added support for overriding the client ID based on authentication results. If an authentication backend returns a `clientid_override` attribute upon successful authentication, it will replace the client’s original client ID.

  The following backends now support `clientid_override`:

  - HTTP
  - JWT
  - LDAP
  - MongoDB
  - MySQL
  - Postgres
  - Redis

- [#15820](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15820) Changed default value of config `authorization.no_match` from `allow` to `deny` for better security defaults.

#### Clustering

- [#15600](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15600) Introduced a new configuration option `cluster.description` that allows you to add a descriptive label to the EMQX cluster.  This description can be updated via `PUT /cluster`, and retrieved with the `GET /cluster` API.

#### LLM-Based MQTT Data Processing

- [#15467](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15467) Exposed transport configuration options for AI Completion Providers. Users can now configure connection timeouts and the maximum number of connections to AI Completion Providers. This helps prevent `checkout_timeout` errors when message throughput is high and the provider is under load.
- Flow designer supports integrating with the [Google Gemini model](https://docs.mqttce.com/en/emqx/v6.0/flow-designer/gemini-node-quick-start.html).

- [#15631](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15631) Added a new API endpoint to list all models available for an AI provider.
- [#15467](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15467) Exposed transport options for AI Completion Providers. These options allow configuring connection timeouts and maximum connections to an AI Completion Provider.
- [#15724](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15724) Introduced `openai_response` type for AI Completion Providers and completion profiles to use OpenAI's `response` API.

#### Data Integration

- [#15418](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15418) EMQX supports data integration with BigQuery.

- [#15401](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15401) Added support for the Snowpipe Streaming upload mode in the Snowflake Action.
  *Note: Snowpipe Streaming is currently a* [*preview feature*](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/release-notes/preview-features) *and is only available for Snowflake accounts hosted on AWS.*

- [#15387](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15387) Added rate limiting to Kinesis Producer Connector and Action health checks to comply with AWS API quotas and improve cluster behavior.

  - Health check calls to `ListStreams` and `DescribeStream` are now limited to 5/s and 10/s per Connector, respectively, matching AWS rate limits.
  - A distributed limiter is coordinated by a core node in the cluster to enforce these limits consistently.
  - If a health check is throttled or times out, the Connector or Action will now retain its previous status instead of being marked as disconnected.

  Also introduced a new `resource_opts.health_check_interval_jitter`, which adds a uniform random delay to `resource_opts.health_check_interval` to reduce the chance of multiple Actions under the same Connector running health checks at the same time.

- [#15176](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15176) Upgraded the GreptimeDB Connector client and supported an optional new parameter `ttl` to set the default time-to-live for automatically created tables.

- [#15649](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15649) EMQX supports data integration with AWS AlloyDB, CockroachDB, and AWS Redshift.

- [#15635](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15635) Added new `key` and `tag` template fields in the RocketMQ Action, allowing customization of the message's key and tag. Also, introduced a new `key_dispatch` option for the `Produce Strategy` field.

- [#15621](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15621) Now, `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` are optional fields for the S3 Tables Connector.  If omitted, they'll be obtained from the Instance Metadata Service v2 APIs from the EC2 instance where EMQX is deployed.

- [#15628](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15628) Removed HStreamDB data integration.

- [#15544](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15544) Added Arrow Flight SQL NIF driver support for Datalayers Integration.

- [#15637](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15637) Added support for templating message headers and properties for the RabbitMQ Action.

- [#15864](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15864) Removed the deprecated "Bridges V1" APIs and configuration schemas. All endpoints under `/bridges/*` and configuration entries under the `bridges` root key are no longer available, as data integrations have fully migrated to the "Connectors/Actions/Sources" model.

- [#15583](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15583) Updated the `brod` client to version 4.4.4, expanding support for a wider range of Kafka APIs. This update addresses the deprecation of `JoinGroups` API versions `v0` - `v1`.

#### Smart Data Hub

- [#15525](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15525) Prevented deletion of internal schemas that are still in use. If a schema is referenced by a Schema Validation or Message Transformation, it can no longer be removed to avoid runtime errors and configuration inconsistencies.

#### Durable Storage

- [#15463](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15463) Improved durable storage RAM usage and storage efficiency.
  - Introduced the following configuration parameters for the durable storage to improve control over RocksDB memory usage and storage performance:
    - `durable_storage.messages.rocksdb.write_buffer_size`: RocksDB memtable size per shard.
    - `durable_storage.messages.rocksdb.cache_size`: RocksDB block size per shard.
    - `durable_storage.messages.rocksdb.max_open_files`: Limits the number of file descriptors used by RocksDB per shard.
    - `durable_storage.messages.layout.wildcard_thresholds`: Allows to tune wildcard thresholds for the `wildcard_optimized_v2` storage layout.
  - Additionally, the default `serialization_schema` for stored messages has been changed to `asn1`.

- [#16044](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16044) Some of config fields for durable sessions have been removed or renamed, and old values are marked as deprecated:

    - `durable_sessions.heartbeat_interval` has been renamed to `durable_sessions.checkpoint_interval`.
    - `durable_sessions.idle_poll_interval` and `durable_sessions.renew_streams_interval` have been removed, as sessions are now fully event-driven.
    - `durable_sessions.session_gc_interval` and `durable_sessions.session_gc_batch_size` have been removed as obsolete.

#### CLI

- [#15399](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15399) The `node_dump` tool now exports the current system configuration in HOCON format, with sensitive information (such as passwords and secrets) automatically redacted for security.

#### Namespace

- [#15841](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15841) Improved the refresh rate of the session count for namespaced sessions.

  - If a namespace has fewer than 1000 connections, its session count is now updated on demand.
  - For namespaces with 1000 or more connections, the count is updated every 5 seconds.

  During a rolling upgrade from versions prior to 6.0, session counts may appear inconsistent due to changes in the internal tracking tables. This is expected: as clients reconnect to upgraded nodes, the session counts will gradually stabilize and become accurate once all nodes are running version 6.0 or later.

#### Observability

- [#15594](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15594) Introduced a new configuration option `trace.max_traces` to control the maximum number of active cluster-wide traces. This limit does not apply to node-local traces managed using `emqx ctl trace`.

  This update also optimized tracing implementation to eliminate potential atom leaks per created trace.

- [#15556](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15556) Introduced a new configuration option `trace.max_file_size` to limit the maximum file size for each individual trace.

- [#15650](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15650) Implemented automatic trace log rotation.

  When a trace file size exceeds `trace.max_file_size`, EMQX no longer discards all subsequent events and emits an incomprehensible warning to `stderr`. Instead, portions of the oldest events are discarded while the most recent ones are retained.

  As such, this also implies that:

  * EMQX now maintains multiple trace log files per active trace. The layout of the trace directory has changed accordingly.
  * Trace API has been updated to reflect this behavior. The Log Stream API may return new errors, such as when a stream becomes stale due to a slow consumer.


- [#15904](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15904) Support viewing and updating of tracing configuration through Trace API.

#### Performance

- [#15451](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15451) Introduced an experimental `socket` backend for TCP listeners, aimed at improving message processing latency and reducing compute resource usage. The feature can be enabled with the new `tcp_backend` listener option.

#### Build and Tooling

- [#15484](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15484) Switched the build system to [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)'s [Mix](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/introduction-to-mix.html), enabling all packages to include native Elixir support. This change improves developer tooling, allows integration with Elixir dependencies when needed, and enables use of the [IEx](https://hexdocs.pm/iex/IEx.html) shell as a more powerful EMQX console.

#### License

- [#15921](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15921) Introduced a license alarm for cluster-wide maximum transactions per second (TPS).
  - Each node calculates TPS as the average number of MQTT messages sent and received over the past 10 seconds.
  - The total cluster TPS is aggregated every 5 seconds.
  - If the observed TPS exceeds the licensed limit, an alarm is triggered.
  - The alarm remains active until a license with a higher TPS allowance is applied.

#### MQTT over QUIC

- [#15997](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15997) Added support for disabling QUIC stack loading by setting the environment variable `QUICER_SKIP_NIF_LOAD=1.`

### Bug Fixes

#### Core MQTT Functionalities

- [#15396](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15396) Removed redundant cleanup operations for shared subscriptions of disconnected clients. These operations were prone to crashes under high disconnect volumes and could lead to inconsistencies in the global broker state.

- [#15361](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15361) Fixed a `function_clause` error when parsing a malformed `User-Property` pair with invalid (too short) length.

- [#15783](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15783) Ensure that any changes to connection rate limits take effect immediately after the listener update has completed. Previously, parts of internal limiter state were not directly affected by configuration changes. For example, after increasing the burst rate, the effective rate limit could appear stricter than expected.

#### Access Control

- [#15489](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15489) Fixed OIDC issuer URL validation in Single Sign-On (SSO) settings. Previously, issuer URLs containing a port number (for example,
  `https://xxxxxxxx:8443/webman/sso/.well-known/openid-configuration`) were rejected with a `bad_port_number` error. These URLs are now supported.

#### Rule Engine

- [#15569](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15569) Fixed an issue where a Republish Rule Action could fail if the `direct_dispatch` template was empty or resolved to a non-boolean value. In these cases, the default value `false` is now used.

#### Data Integration

- [#15522](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15522) Fixed an issue where Snowflake Connector would fail to start correctly if `username` was not provided.
- [#15476](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15476) Fixed a missing callback in `emqx_connector_aggreg_delivery` that caused a crash when formatting delivery process status for aggregated-mode Actions (e.g., Azure Blob Storage, Snowflake, S3 Tables).
  This occurred during failures or when inspecting delivery processes with `gen_server:format_status/1`. The issue is now resolved, and more detailed delivery status information will be logged.
- [#15394](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15394) Fixed a rare race condition where Action metrics could become inconsistent due to unexpected asynchronous replies.
- [#15647](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15647) Fixed an issue where a MongoDB Connector was marked as `Disconnected` if the MongoDB account specified in the connector configuration lacked privileges to perform `find` queries on the `foo` collection.
- [#15603](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15603) Fixed an issue in the MQTT bridge where a stale connection could be shown as `Connected` and would not automatically reconnect.
- [#15383](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15383) Fixed a potential resource leak in MQTT bridge. When a bridge failed to start, the topic index table was not properly cleaned up.
- [#15786](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15786) Fixed a potential atom leak when probing RocketMQ Connectors.
- [#15806](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15806) Improved validation for Oracle Actions during creation. Previously, in rare cases, an Action containing an invalid SQL statement could be added successfully.
- [#15848](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15848) Improved error reporting for the Oracle Connector. When the connector becomes disconnected, its status now includes a more specific reason, making diagnostics easier.
- [#15693](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15693) Fixed a resource leak in Postgres-based bridges. Under certain race conditions during pool initialization, deleting a Connector could leave its connection pool behind. This has been corrected to ensure connection pools are properly cleaned up.
- [#15543](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15543) Fixed an issue in HTTP Server data integration when sending large payloads. If the payload size was 10 MB or more, the HTTP request could fail.

- [#15839](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15839) Fixed an encoding issue with Protobuf schemas that use `map<_, _>` fields.
  Previously, schemas containing `map<string, string>` fields could fail to encode valid payloads, resulting in cryptic runtime errors.

  Example schema:

  ```protobuf
  syntax = "proto3";
  
  message test {
  map<string, string> args = 1;
  }
  ```

  Example rule:

  ```sql
  SELECT
  schema_encode('xxx', json_decode(payload), 'test') as protobuf_test
  FROM
  "t/#"
  ```

  Example payload failed to be encoded:

  ```json
  {
  "args": {
  "env": "stag"
  }
  }
  ```

  Previous error similar to:

  ```

  ```

#### Observability

- [#15931](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15931) Resolved a bug where spurious but harmless error logs could appear during node startup:
    ```
    [error] Generic event handler emqx_alarm_handler crashed ...
    Reason: {aborted,{no_exists,[emqx_activated_alarm,runq_overload]}}
    ```

- [#15973](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15973) Fixed a bug where an alarm activation timeout could crash the connection process under certain conditions.

#### MQTT over QUIC

- [#15614](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15614) QUIC Listener: When TLS key logging (`SSLKEYLOGFILE`) is enabled, EMQX now dumps TLS keys even if the handshake fails.

#### Clustering

- [#16021](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16021) Fixed issues that occasionally prevented the DS Raft backend from functioning correctly when an existing node joined a new cluster and subsequently became member of DS replica sets.

#### Cluster Linking

- [#15894](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15894) Previously, when listing all cluster links via `GET /cluster/links`, disabled links would be returned having an `inconsistent` status. Now they are returned as `disconnected`.

#### Performance

- [#15696](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15696) Added connection rate limiting support for WebSocket (WS) and WebSocket Secure (WSS) listeners.
  The `max_conn_rate` and `max_conn_burst` configuration options are now enforced: incoming connections exceeding the defined rate are immediately closed upon acceptance, consistent with existing TCP listener behavior.

  Additionally, the behavior of `max_connections` has been updated. When the connection limit is exceeded, WS/WSS listeners now close connections immediately before any HTTP handshake, resulting in an abrupt socket close instead of returning an HTTP 429 response.

- [#15854](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15854) Reduced the default `active_n` value from `100` to `10` to improve MQTT client responsiveness, especially under high message rates with small payloads.

  The lower `active_n` introduces more backpressure at the TCP layer, stricter than the default `Receive-Maximum` of `32`, which helps in the following scenarios:

  - The client process is blocked by external authorization checks
  - Data integration operations are delaying message handling
  - The system is under heavy load or nearing resource limits

- [#15981](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15981) Prevented excessive memory growth caused by Mnesia transaction blocking during cleanup of large volumes of audit logs. This improves system stability and memory efficiency during heavy audit log maintenance operations.
