# Enable SSL/TLS Connection

When accepting an MQTT Client or connecting to external resources like a database,
EMQX can establish secure connections via SSL/TLS.

## SSL Listener for MQTT

### TLS Authentication

To enable TLS authentication for clients, one may add an `ssl` listener
and set its `ssl_options.verify` option to `verify_peer`.

The default `ssl` MQTT listener runs on the 8883 port:

```hcl
listeners.ssl.default {
  bind = "0.0.0.0:8883"

  access_rules = [
    "allow all"
  ]

  proxy_protocol = false
  proxy_protocol_timeout = 3s

  ssl_options.keyfile = "etc/certs/key.pem"
  ssl_options.certfile = "etc/certs/cert.pem"
  ssl_options.cacertfile = "etc/certs/cacert.pem"

  # to verify client certs
  ssl_options.verify = verify_peer

  ssl_options.versions = ["tlsv1.3", "tlsv1.2", "tlsv1.1", "tlsv1"]
  tcp_options.backlog = 1024
  tcp_options.buffer = 4KB
}
```

::: tip
The `key.pem`,` cert.pem`, and `cacert.pem` under the default directory of `etc/certs` are self-signed certificates generated by EMQX. Therefore, when testing with a client that supports TLS, you need to configure the above CA certificate `etc/certs/cacert.pem` to the client.

For production use, securely issued certificates must be used.

### PSK Authentication

To enable PSK authentication, one should enable `psk_authentication` section in `emqx.conf`:

```hcl
psk_authentication {
    ## Whether to enable the PSK feature.
    enable = true

    ## If init file is specified, emqx will import PSKs from the file
    ## into the built-in database at startup for use by the runtime.
    ##
    ## The file has to be structured line-by-line, each line must be in
    ## the format: <PSKIdentity>:<SharedSecret>
    init_file = "data/init.psk"

    ## Specifies the separator for PSKIdentity and SharedSecret in the init file.
    ## The default is colon (:)
    separator = ":"

    ## The size of each chunk used to import to the built-in database from psk file
    ## chunk_size = 50
}
```

File with psk identities and keys (`data/init.psk`) should be created:

```
myclient1:8c701116e9127c57a99d5563709af3deaca75563e2c4dd0865701ae839fb6d79
myclient2:d1e617d3b963757bfc21dad3fea169716c3a2f053f23decaea5cdfaabd04bfc4
```

`ssl` listener should be configured to use PSK ciphers:

```hcl
listeners.ssl.default {
  ...
  ssl_options.versions = ["tlsv1.2"]
  ssl_options.ciphers = "PSK-AES256-GCM-SHA384,PSK-AES128-GCM-SHA256,PSK-AES256-CBC-SHA384,PSK-AES256-CBC-SHA,PSK-AES128-CBC-SHA256,PSK-AES128-CBC-SHA,RSA-PSK-AES256-GCM-SHA384,RSA-PSK-AES256-CBC-SHA384,RSA-PSK-AES128-GCM-SHA256,RSA-PSK-AES128-CBC-SHA256,RSA-PSK-AES256-CBC-SHA,RSA-PSK-AES128-CBC-SHA,RSA-PSK-RC4-SHA"
  ...
}

```

**Notice**:

If the `RSA-PSK` cipher suites are used, the `RSA` certificate is still required, see [RFC4279](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4279#section-4) for details.

### OCSP Stapling

Since EMQX version v5.0.23 and e5.0.3, Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) Stapling is supported for MQTT SSL listeners.  Note that those do not include Secure WebSocket nor QUIC listeners: only listeners of type `ssl` support this feature.

With this feature enabled, the listener will send an OCSP Stapling response to connecting clients about EMQX's server certificate.  This OCSP data is periodically fetched from a configured OCSP Responder server and cached for a period of time (5 minutes by default).

In order to enable this feature, we need to both enable the corresponding option in the listener, and also specify the OCSP Issuer certificate and OCSP Responder URL from which EMQX should download and cache the OCSP response for its own server certificate.

Example configuration to enable OCSP Stapling:

```hcl
listeners.ssl.default {
  bind = "0.0.0.0:8883"
  max_connections = 512000
  ssl_options {
    keyfile = "/etc/emqx/certs/server.key"
    certfile = "/etc/emqx/certs/server.pem"
    cacertfile = "/etc/emqx/certs/ca.pem"
    ocsp {
      enable_ocsp_stapling = true
      issuer_pem = "/etc/emqx/certs/ocsp-issuer.pem"
      responder_url = "http://ocsp.responder.com:9877"
      refresh_interval = 15m
      refresh_http_timeout = 15s
    }
  }
}
```

Be sure to change the certificate/private key paths above with your corresponding files, and also to set your OCSP Responder URL accordingly.

### CRL Check

Since EMQX version v5.0.23 and e5.0.3, Certification Revocation List (CRL) Check is supported for MQTT SSL listeners.  Note that those do not include Secure WebSocket nor QUIC listeners: only listeners of type `ssl` support this feature.

With this feature enabled, EMQX will attempt to verify if connecting client certificates are not revoked according to the CRL Distribution Point described in the client's certificate, and deny connection to revoked client certificates during the SSL/TLS handshake phase of the connection.

In order to enable this feature, we need to both enable the corresponding option in the listener, and also set the `verify` option of the listener to `verify_peer`, so that the client must be checked against the CRL.

Example configuration to enable OCSP Stapling:

```hcl
listeners.ssl.default {
  bind = "0.0.0.0:8883"
  max_connections = 512000
  ssl_options {
    keyfile = "/etc/emqx/certs/server.key"
    certfile = "/etc/emqx/certs/server.pem"
    cacertfile = "/etc/emqx/certs/ca.pem"
    verify = verify_peer
    enable_crl_check = true
  }
}
```

## SSL Client for External Resources

Apart from allowing to receive a two-way SSL MQTT client, EMQX also provides access to external resources via SSL.

For example, to access a web server via HTTPS:

![Configure HTTPS Client](./assets/http-tls.jpg)

When creating any connection to an external resource, you can choose to enable TLS and configure its SSL certificate. As shown above:

- When **TLS Verify** is enabled, the **CA Cert** field must be filled in to verify the legitimacy of the server certificate.
- When the server needs to verify the client certificate, then **TLS Cert** and **TLS Key** must be filled in.
- **SNI** meanings Server Name Indication, indicates whether the server domain name and certificate are verified to be the same; A null value means no validation.

In addition, it is also can be configured in the `emqx.conf`:

```hcl
authentication {
  url = "https://127.0.0.1:8080"
  backend = "http"

  ...

  ssl {
    enable = true
    cacertfile = "etc/certs/cacert.pem"
    certfile = "etc/certs/cert.pem"
    keyfile = "etc/certs/key.pem"
    ## `verify_peer` means turn on verification for server certificate
    verify = verify_peer
  }
}
```
