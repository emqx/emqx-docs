# Data Sources and Fields

Rules in EMQX can process data from various data sources, including **MQTT Messages**, **MQTT Events**, or **Data Bridges**.

As discussed in the [Rule Engine Syntax](./rule-sql-syntax.md) section, you can use the `FROM` clause to specify the data source and the corresponding fields can be referenced in the `SELECT` and `where` clauses. This section will introduce the fields for [Data Bridges](#data-bridges), [MQTT Messages](#mqtt-message), and [MQTT Events](#mqtt-events). 

## Data Bridges

Rules use topics prefixed by `$bridges/` to present messages or events triggered by a data bridge. The format is:

 `$bridges/<type>:<name>`

Where

-  `<type>:<name>` is the bridge Id, 
- `<type>` is the bridge type, 
- `<name>` is the bridge name.

For example, the MQTT Bridge events can be referred to in the format of  `"$bridges/mqtt:*`. To set a rule for all messages sent by the MQTT data bridge named `my_mqtt_bridge`, you can use the statement below:

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  "$bridges/mqtt:my_mqtt_bridge"
```

**Output:**

```json
{
  "id": "0005E27C1D24E44FF440000017520000",
  "server": "broker.emqx.io:1883",
  "payload": "hello",
  "topic": "t/a",
  "qos": 1,
  "dup": false,
  "retain": false,
  "pub_props": {
    "Message-Expiry-Interval": 30,
    "Payload-Format-Indicator": 0,
    "User-Property": {
      "foo": "bar"
    },
    "User-Property-Pairs": [
      {
        "key": "foo"
      },
      {
        "value": "bar"
      }
    ]
  },
  "message_received_at": 1645002753259,
}
```

| `message_received_at` | Timestamp when the message is received (unit: ms)            |

## MQTT Message

You can use EMQX rules to handle message publishing, in this case, you need to specify the message topics with the `FROM` clause. 

For example, in the following statement, you will select fields `payload.msg` (then rename as msg with the `AS` clause), `clientid`, `username`, `payload`, `topic`, and `qos` for any message published to topics following the pattern `t/#`.

Example:
```sql
SELECT
  payload.msg as msg,
  clientid,
  username,
  payload,
  topic,
  qos
FROM
  "t/#"
```

Output:

```json
{
  "username": "u_emqx",
  "topic": "t/a",
  "qos": 1,
  "payload": "{\"msg\":\"hello\"}",
  "msg": "hello",
  "clientid": "c_emqx"
}
```

## MQTT Events

You can use EMQX rules to handle event notifications, for example, client online and offline, client subscriptions, etc. In this case, you can use the `FROM` clause to specify the event topics. The event topic starts with `"$events/"`, such as `"$events/client_connected"`. 

::: tip

By default, clients are unable to subscribe directly to MQTT event messages. This tutorial will guide you through the process of using rules to subscribe to these messages. To enable direct subscriptions for MQTT event messages with your clients, you must first add the following configuration items to the `emqx.conf` file. After saving the modifications, restart EMQX to apply the new settings.

```bash
sys_topics {
	sys_event_messages {
		client_connected = true,
		client_disconnected = true,
		client_subscribed = true,
		client_unsubscribed = true
	}
}
```

### Message Delivery Event ("$events/message_delivered")

This event topic can be used to trigger a rule when a message is delivered to a client.

For example, to extract data from the `"$events/message_delivered"` event topic that includes the following data fields, ID and username of the publisher, message topic, message QoS, EMQX node with the event triggered, and the time when the event was triggered, you can use the statement below:

Example:
```sql
SELECT
  from_clientid,
  from_username,
  topic,
  qos,
  node,
  timestamp
FROM
  "$events/message_delivered"
```
Output:
```json
{
  "topic": "t/a",
  "timestamp": 1645002753259,
  "qos": 1,
  "node": "emqx@127.0.0.1",

For example, to extract data from the `"$events/client_connected"` event topic that includes the following data fields: client ID and username, keepalive interval, and whether the connected MQTT client is acting as a bridge, you can use the statement below:

FROM
  "$events/client_connected"
```
Output:
```json

### Disconnect Event ("$events/client_disconnected")

This event topic can be used to trigger a rule when a client is disconnected.

For example, you can use the statement below to extract data from the `"$events/client_disconnected"` event topic that includes the following data fields: client ID, username, disconnect reason, disconnect time, and EMQX node where the event is triggered.

Example:
```sql
SELECT
  clientid,
  username,
  reason,
  disconnected_at,
  node
FROM
  "$events/client_disconnected"
```
Output:
```json
{
  "username": "u_emqx",
  "reason": "normal",
  "node": "emqx@127.0.0.1",
  "disconnected_at": 1645003578536,
  "clientid": "c_emqx"
}
```

### Connection Acknowlege Event ("$events/client_connack")

This event topic can be used to trigger a rule when the EMQX sends a `CONNACK` packet to the client. 

Example:

```sql
SELECT
  clientid,
  username,
  reason,
  node
FROM
  "$events/client_connack"
```

Output:

```json

[^*]: The MQTT v5.0 protocol renames the return code to a reason code, adding a reason code to indicate more types of errors ([Reason code and ACK - MQTT 5.0 new features](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/mqtt5-new-features-reason-code-and-ack)).

Here is the reason code for MQTT v3.1.1 and MQTT v5.0.
