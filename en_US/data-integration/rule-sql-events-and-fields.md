# SQL data sources and fields

The data sources that SQL statements can process are **MQTT Messages**, **MQTT Events**, or **Data Bridges**.

The SQL statement uses `FROM` clause to specify the data source, and the corresponding fields can be referenced in the `SELECT` and `where` clauses.

Different data source types have different fields.

## Data Bridges

Rules use topics prefixed by `$bridges/` to present messages or events triggered by a data bridge.
The format is: `$bridges/<type>:<name>`.

Where `<type>:<name>` is the bridge Id, `<type>` is the bridge type, `<name>` is the bridge name.
Such as `$bridges/mqtt:my_mqtt_bridge`.

### MQTT Bridge Events ("$bridges/mqtt:*")

Triggered by an MQTT Bridge when a message is received from the remote MQTT broker.

    ]
  },

}
```

## MQTT Message

The SQL statement of the rules engine can handle the message publishing. In a rule statement, the user can specify one or more topics with the FROM clause, and the rule will be triggered when any message is published to the specified topic.

| node                  | Node name of the trigger event                  |

Example:
```sql
SELECT
  payload.msg as msg,
  clientid,
  username,
  payload,
  topic,
  qos
FROM
  "t/#"
```

Output:
```json
{
  "username": "u_emqx",
  "topic": "t/a",
  "qos": 1,
  "payload": "{\"msg\":\"hello\"}",
  "msg": "hello",
  "clientid": "c_emqx"
}
```

## MQTT Events
The SQL statements of the rule engine can handle both messages (message publishing) and events (client online and offline, client subscription, etc.). For messages, the FROM clause is directly followed by the topic name; for events, the FROM clause is followed by the event topic.

The topic of the event message starts with `"$events/"`, such as `"$events/client_connected",` `"$events/session_subscribed"`.
If you want emqx to publish the event message, you can configure it in the `emqx_rule_engine.conf` file.

The MQTT v5.0 protocol renames the return code to a reason code, adding a reason code to indicate more types of errors([Reason code and ACK - MQTT 5.0 new features](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/mqtt5-new-features-reason-code-and-ack)).
