# Rule SQL Reference

EMQX uses a SQL-based syntax in its rules for data extraction, filtering, enrichment, and transformation. This SQL-like syntax has two types of statements: `SELECT` and `FOREACH`. 

| Statement | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `SELECT`  | For situations where the result of the SQL statement is a single message. |
| `FOREACH` | For producing zero or more messages from a single input message. |

Each rule can have exactly one statement. SQL statements provide a rich set of built-in functions, enabling you to perform simple transformations and create timestamps, among other operations. 

SQL statements also supports embedding [jq programs](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) within expressions, which allows you to do complex data transformations whenever required. Expressions can be embedded within the `SELECT` and `FOREACH` statements. For the fields that can be referenced in the `SELECT` and `FOREACH` statements, see [Data Sources and Fields](./rule-sql-events-and-fields.md).

## The `SELECT` Statement 

The `SELECT` statement selects specific fields from an input message, rename fields, transform data, and filter messages based on conditions. 

The basic format of a `SELECT` statement in the rule engine SQL is as follows:

```sql
SELECT <fields_expressions> FROM <topic> [WHERE <conditions>]
```

You can use the `SELECT` clause to specify which fields (from both message payload and metadata) to include in the output, and use the  `WHERE` clause to filter messages based on specific conditions 

### The `FROM` Clause

The `FROM` clause is used to specify the data source for your query. You can choose to select data from specific topics or events that match a certain condition.

#### Select by Topics

For example, if you want to defines a rule applies to all messages published to topics matching the pattern `t/#` and `my/other/topic`, you can work with the statement below:

```sql
SELECT clientid, payload.clientid as myclientid FROM "t/#", "my/other/topic"
```

Where, 

- the `SELECT` clause is to specify the fields to be included in the output

  - `clientid`: is the client ID in the metadata

  - `payload.clientid`: is the client ID in the message payload. All fields in the message payload are stored under `payload`.

    - The `as` syntax renames the `payload.clientid` field as `myclientid`. 


#### Select by Events

You can also attach rules to events. For example, if you want to get the IP address and port number when client `c1` initiates a connection to EMQX, you can use the statement below:

```sql
SELECT peername as ip_port FROM "$events/client_connected" WHERE clientid = 'c1'
```

::: tip

You can find all available events in the EMQX Dashboard (under the **Events** tab when editing a rule).

:::

### The `WHERE` Clause

The `WHERE` clause provides an optional way to refine message filtering by specifying additional conditions that the messages must meet, in addition to the topic/event filter specified in the `FROM` clause.

For instance, the following SQL statement filters messages under topic `t/#` that are sent by the user name `eric`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM "t/#" WHERE username = 'eric'
```

::: tip

The fields used in the `WHERE` clause must be one field available in the message metadata or payload, or there will be an error. 

:::

### Work with Expressions

[Expressions](#expressions-and-operations) can also be used to transform data in the `SELECT` and `WHERE` clause. For example, the following SQL statement formats the `clientid` field value by converting it to uppercase and adding a suffix. The result is named `cid` in the output message: 

```sql
SELECT (upper(clientid) + '_UPPERCASE_LETTERS') as cid FROM "t/#"
```

The following showcase the use of a parenthesized arithmetic expression to transform data: 

```sql
SELECT (payload.integer_field + 2) * 2 as num FROM "t/#"
```

You can also use dot notation to access fields in a payload with a complex structure (this assumes that the payload is JSON formatted): 

```sql
SELECT payload.a.b.c.deep as my_field FROM "t/#"
```

The statement below shows an example of how the equality operator (=) can be used to test that a field has a certain value in the WHERE-clause. Using * in the SELECT-clause will forward all metadata and the payload to the output message:

```sql
SELECT * FROM "t/#" WHERE payload.x.y = 1
```

You can use the `and` and `or` operators to form complex boolean expressions in the WHERE-clause:

```sql
SELECT * FROM "t/#" WHERE payload.name = "sensor_1" and payload.temprature > 39
```

## The `FOREACH` Statement

The `FOREACH` statement can be seen as a more general form of the `SELECT` statement. It can produce zero or more output messages for each input message. You can use the `FOREACH` statement to filter data based on specific conditions and output the results to MQTT topics or data bridges. 

The basic format of a `FOREACH` statement in the rule engine SQL is as follows:

```sql
FOREACH <expression_that_evaluates_to_array> [as <name>]
[DO <fields_expressions>]
[INCASE <condition>]
FROM <topic>
[WHERE <condition>]
```

A `FOREACH` statement starts with a `FOREACH`-clause that is used to create an array from the input message. The `FROM` and `WHERE` clauses have the same purpose and work the same as the clauses with the corresponding names in the SELECT statement. Besides the `FOREACH`, `FROM` and `WHERE` clauses, the `FOREACH` statement has two more optional clauses:

| Clause   | Optional/Required | Description                                                  |
| -------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `DO`     | Optional          | Transform each element in the array selected by `FOREACH`.<br /><br />Correspond to the `SELECT` clause in the `SELECT` statement and accepts the same expressions. |
| `INCASE` | Optional          | Filter out array elements that do not match the specified conditions.<br /><br />Accepts the same expressions as the `WHERE` clause. |

::: tip

Except for the FOREACH clause, all other clauses in the `FOREACH` statement have corresponding clauses in the `SELECT` statement. This implies that the FOREACH statement can be seen as a generalization of the `SELECT` statement, as mentioned earlier. The following two statements are equivalent (note that `jq('.', payload)` wraps the payload inside an array): 

```sql
FOREACH jq('.', payload) as it
DO it.field_1, it.field_2 
FROM "t/#"
```

```sql
SELECT payload.field_1, payload.field_2
FROM "t/#"
```
:::

The as-syntax in the FOREACH clause exemplified above is utilized to assign a name to the array items, which allows for easy referencing of the "current" item within the DO clause. If the "`as name`" part is omitted, the default name "item" will be used.

Below is an example to show how to use the `FOREACH` statement to output two values. Both values contain only one field called `value`. The value of the field `value` is the value of the field `field_1` in one of the messages and the value of `field_2` in the other message:

```sql 
FOREACH jq('[.field_1, .field_2]', payload) 
DO item as value
FROM "t/#"
```

The `FOREACH` statement requires input data to be in an array format. If the input message already contains an array, you can directly apply the `FOREACH` statement. 

For example, for messages published to topics `t/#`, if you want to output the timestamp, client ID, sensor name, and index when the sensor idx is 1 or above, you can use the code below:

<!--- Removed inline comments as the rule engine does not currently support comments as far as I know -->
```sql
FOREACH
    payload.sensors as sensor  
DO
    timestamp,
    clientid,
    upper(sensor.name) as name,
    sensor.idx as idx
INCASE
    sensor.idx >= 1
FROM "t/#"
```

Where,

- The `FOREACH`-clause specifies the `sensors` field in the input message's payload as the array to iterate over. It also names the array itmes `sensor` with the "`as nane`"-syntax.
- The `DO` clause specifies the fields to be included in the output:
  - `timestamp` is the timestamp from the input message's metadata.
  - `clientid` is the client ID from the input message's metadata.
  - `sensor.name` will be capitalized with the build-in `upper` function and renamed as `name` with the "`as name`"-syntax. Please note that "sensor" specifically refers to the current item within the array that is selected by the FOREACH clause.
  - `sensor.idx`  will be renamed as `idx` with the `as` clause.
- The `INCASE` clause adds another filter condition, so you only get sensors where the value of the idx-field is 1 and above.
- The `FROM` clause specifies that you want messages from topics that match the pattern "t/#". 

After creating your rules, it's always recommended to test your rules before putting them into production. The Dashboard UI contains a test feature that allows you to test your rules with sample messages. For details on how to test the SQL statements, see [Test the Rule](./rule-get-started.md#test-the-rule). The rule above can be tested by putting in the following JSON formatted text as payload:

```json
{"sensors": [
    {"idx":0, "name":"t0"},
    {"idx":1, "name":"t1"},
    {"idx":2, "name":"t2"}
  ]
}
```

If the input message does not contain an array, you can use the `jq` function to wrap the payload in an array, for example, in the code below. 

```sql
FOREACH jq('.', payload) 
DO item.field_1, item.field_2 
FROM "t/#"
```

EMQX supports using the `jq` function for advanced transformations. You can refer to the [ build-in `jq` function](./rule-sql-jq.md) for more code examples.

## Expressions and Operations 

EMQX rule syntax allows using expressions to transform data and filter messages, which can be used in various clauses, including `SELECT`, `FOREACH`, `DO`, `INCASE`, and `WHERE`. This section offers more information on using these expressions. The following are the operations that can be used to form expressions, and remember that there is a wide range of [built-in functions](./rule-sql-builtin-functions.md) that can also be used in expressions.


### Arithmetic Operations

| Function | Purpose                                                                                               | Returned value              |      |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------                                          | --------------------------- | ---- |
| `+`      | addition, or string concatenation                                                                     | Sum, or concatenated string |      |
| `-`      | Subtraction                                                                                           | Difference                  |      |
| `*`      | multiplication                                                                                        | product                     |      |
| `/`      | division                                                                                              | Quotient                    |      |
| `div`    | Integer division                                                                                      | Integer quotient            |      |
| `mod`    | modulus                                                                                               | module                      |      |


### Logical Operations

| Function | Purpose | Returned Value |
| ------ | ------------------- | ---------- |
| `>` | greater than | true/false |
| `<` | less than | true/false |
| `<=` | less than or equal | true/false |
| `>=` | greater than or equal | true/false |
| `<>` | not equal | true/false |
| `!=` | not equal | true/false |
| `=`      | Check if the two operands are completely equal. It can be used to compare values                      | true/false                  |
| `=~`     | Check if a topic can match the topic filter. It can only be used for topic matching                   | true/false                  |
| `and`    | logical and                                                                                           | true/false                  |
| `or`     | logical or                                                                                            | true/false                  |


### CASE Expressions 

The `CASE` expression can be used to perform conditional operations. A case expression corresponds to an if-then-else statement in other languages. How to use the `CASE` expression is illustrated by the following example.

```sql
SELECT
  CASE WHEN payload.x < 0 THEN 0
       WHEN payload.x > 7 THEN 7
       ELSE payload.x
  END as x
FROM "t/#"
```

Suppose the message is:

```json
{"x": 8}
```

Then the output will be:

```json
{"x": 7}
```

## More Examples

### Examples of `SELECT` Statements 

-  Extract all fields from the messages with the topic "t/a":
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM "t/a"
    ```
-  Extract all fields from the messages with the topics "t/a" or "t/b":
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM "t/a","t/b"
    ```
-  Extract all fields from the message with a topic that matches 't/#'.
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM "t/#"
    ```
-  Extract the qos, username, and clientid fields from the input message with a topic that matches 't/#' (the output message will have a payload with the fields qos, username, and clientid):
    ```sql
    SELECT qos, username, clientid FROM "t/#"
    ```
-  Extract the username field from any message with a payload field named username with the value 'Steven' (it is not recommended to use the [topic filter](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/advanced-features-of-mqtt-topics) '#' in the FROM clause as this means that the rule has to be checked for all messages that are sent to EMQX):
    ```sql
    SELECT username FROM "#" WHERE username='Steven'
    ```
- Extract the `x` field from the payload of the input message and rename the field to `y` in the output message. The new alias `y` for `payload.x` can also be used in the `WHERE` clause. A rule with this SQL statement matches messages with the payload `{"x": 1}` but not messages with the payload `{"x": 2}`:
    ```sql
    SELECT payload.x as x FROM "tests/test_topic_1" WHERE y = 1
    ```
- This SQL statement matches messages with the payload `{"x": {"y": 1}}` (and for example `{"x": {"y": 1}, "other": "field}`):
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM "#" WHERE payload.x.y = 1
    ```
-  If an MQTT client with clientid = 'c1' connected, extract its source IP address and port number:
    ```sql
    SELECT peername as ip_port FROM "$events/client_connected" WHERE clientid = 'c1'
    ```
- Matches all subscriptions to topics that matches the pattern 't/topic' and have a quality of service (QoS) level of 1. It extracts the clientid to the output message.
    ```sql
    SELECT clientid FROM "$events/session_subscribed" WHERE topic = 'my/topic' and qos = 1
    ```
- Similar to the above example but here the topic match operator `=~` is used to match the [topic filter](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/advanced-features-of-mqtt-topics) 't/#':
    ```sql
    SELECT clientid FROM "$events/session_subscribed" WHERE topic =~ 't/#' and qos = 1
    ```
- Extract the User Property with Key "foo" (User properties is new in the MQTT 5.0 protocol so this is not relevant for older MQTT versions):
    ```sql
    SELECT pub_props.'User-Property'.foo as foo FROM "t/#"
    ```

::: tip
- Topics in the `FROM` clause need to be enclosed in double quotes (`""`).
- The `WHERE` clause is followed by the filter condition. If a string is used in the condition, it needs to be enclosed in single quotes (`''`).
- If there are multiple topics in the FROM clause, they need to be separated by commas `","`. For example, `SELECT * FROM "topic1", "topic2" WHERE topic1.id = topic2.id`.

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM "t/1", "t/2".
    ```
- You can use the period symbol (`.`) to access inner fields of the payload. For example, if the payload is a nested JSON structure, you can use `payload.outer_field.inner_field` to access the `inner_field` of the `outer_field`. 
:::

### Examples of `FOREACH` Statements

Suppose there are messages with client ID `c_steve` coming to the topic ` t/1`. The message body is in JSON format, and the sensors field is an array containing multiple objects as is shown in the following example:

```json
{
    "date": "2020-04-24",
    "sensors": [
        {"name": "a", "idx":0},
        {"name": "b", "idx":1},
        {"name": "c", "idx":2}
    ]
}
```

#### Example 1

In this example it is required that each object in sensors array is re-published to the topic `sensors/${idx}` (where index is taken from the object) with the content of `${name}` (where name is taken from the object). That means that for for the example input given above the rule engine will issue the following three messages:

1. *Topic*: sensors/0
   *Content*: a
2. *Topic*: sensors/1
   *Content*: b
3. *Topic*: sensors/2
   *Content*: c

For the rule in this example, we need to configure the following action:

- *Action type*: message republish
- *Target topic*: `sensors/${idx}`
- *Target QoS*: 2 
- Message content template: `${name}`

And the following SQL statement:

```sql
FOREACH
    payload.sensors
FROM "t/#"
```

In the SQL statement above, the `FOREACH` clause specifies the array `sensors` that needs to be traversed. The `FOREACH` statement will perform a "message republish" action for each object in the result array, so the republish action will be performed three times.



#### Example 2

In this example, it is required that each object in the `sensors` array with a value for the `id` field which is greater than or equal to 1 is re-published to the topic `sensors/${idx}` with the content `clientid=${clientid},name=${name},date=${date}`. This means that the rule will issue two messages when given the example input message specified above (since the array element with the `id` field set to zero will be filtered out).

1. *Topic*: sensors/1
   *Content*: clientid=c_steve,name=b,date=2023-04-24
2. *Topic*: sensors/2
   *Content*: clientid=c_steve,name=c,date=2023-04-24

For the rule in this example, we need to configure the following action:

- *Action type*: message republish
- *Target topic*: `sensors/${idx}`
- *Target QoS*: 2 
- *Message content template*: `clientid=${clientid},name=${name},date=${date}`

And the following SQL statement:

```sql
FOREACH
    payload.sensors
DO
    clientid,
    item.name as name,
    item.idx as idx
INCASE
    item.idx >= 1
FROM "t/#"
```

In the above SQL statement, the `FOREACH` clause specifies that the array `sensors` needs to be traversed. The `DO` clause selects the fields required for each operation. The `clientid` field is selected from the message meta data and `name` and `idx` are selected from the current sensor object. The name `item` represents the current object in the sensors array. The `INCASE` clause specifies a filter condition for the array objects (objects that do not match the filter will be ignored).

In `DO` and `INCASE` clauses, you can use `item` to access the current object, or you can customize a variable name by using the `as` syntax in `FOREACH`. So the SQL statement in this example can also be written as follows:


```sql
FOREACH
    payload.sensors as s
DO
    clientid,
    s.name as name,
    s.idx as idx
INCASE
    s.idx >= 1
FROM "t/#"
```

#### Example 3

This extends Example 2 by also removing the `c_` prefix of `c_steve` in the clientid field.

The rule engine comes with a number of built in functions can be called in the `FOREACH`, `DO` and `INCASE` clauses. If you want to change `c_steve` into `steve`, you can change the SQL in Example 2 into:

```sql
FOREACH
    payload.sensors as s
DO
    nth(2, tokens(clientid,'_')) as clientid,
    s.name as name,
    s.idx as idx
INCASE
    s.idx >= 1
FROM "t/#"
```

Multiple expressions can be placed in the `FOREACH` clause as long as the last expression specifies the array to be traversed.
For example, if the input messages payload was formatted like this instead:

```json
{
    "date": "2020-04-24",
    "data": {
        "sensors": [
            {"name": "a", "idx":0},
            {"name": "b", "idx":1},
            {"name": "c", "idx":2}
        ]
    }
}
```

Then the `FOREACH` clause can give the payload data another name before selecting the array:

```sql
FOREACH
    payload.data as d
    d.sensors as s
...
```

This is equivalent to:

```sql
FOREACH
    payload.data.sensors as s
...
```

This feature can be useful when you are working with payloads that are structured in complex ways.
