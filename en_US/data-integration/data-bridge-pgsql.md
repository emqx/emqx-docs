## How It Works

PostgreSQL data integration is an out-of-the-box feature in EMQX designed to bridge the gap between MQTT-based IoT data and PostgreSQL's powerful data storage capabilities. With a built-in [rule engine](./rules.md) component, the integration simplifies the process of ingesting data from EMQX to PostgreSQL for storage and management, eliminating the need for complex coding.

The diagram below illustrates a typical architecture of data integration between EMQX and PostgreSQL:

Ingesting MQTT data into PostgreSQL works as follows:

- **IoT devices connect to EMQX**: After IoT devices are successfully connected through the MQTT protocol, online events will be triggered. The events include information such as device ID, source IP address, and other attributes.
- **Message publication and reception**: The devices publish telemetry and status data to specific topics. When EMQX receives these messages, it initiates the matching process within its rules engine.
- **Rule Engine Processing Messages**: With the built-in rules engine, messages and events from specific sources can be processed based on topic matching. The rules engine matches the corresponding rules and processes messages and events, such as converting data formats, filtering out specific information, or enriching messages with contextual information.
- **Write to PostgreSQL**: The rule triggers the writing of messages to PostgreSQL. With the help of SQL templates, users can extract data from the rule processing results to construct SQL and send it to PostgreSQL for execution, so that specific fields of the message can be written or updated into the corresponding tables and columns of the database.

After the event and message data are written to PostgreSQL, you can connect to PostgreSQL to read the data for flexible application development, such as:

- Connect to visualization tools, such as Grafana, to generate charts based on data and show data changes.
- Connect to the device management system, view the device list and status, detect abnormal device behavior, and eliminate potential problems in a timely manner.

## Features and Benefits

PostgreSQL is a popular open-source relational database with a rich set of features. The data integration with PostgreSQL can bring the following features and advantages to your business:

- **Flexible Event Handling**: Through the EMQX rules engine, PostgreSQL can handle device lifecycle events, greatly facilitating the development of various management and monitoring tasks required for implementing IoT applications. By analyzing event data, you can promptly detect device failures, abnormal behavior, or trend changes to take appropriate measures.
- **Message Transformation**: Messages can undergo extensive processing and transformation through EMQX rules before being written to PostgreSQL, making storage and usage more convenient.
- **Flexible Data Operations**: With SQL templates provided by PostgreSQL data bridging, it's easy to write or update data from specific fields to the corresponding tables and columns in the PostgreSQL database, enabling flexible data storage and management.
- **Integration of Business Processes**: PostgreSQL data bridging allows you to integrate device data with PostgreSQL's rich ecosystem applications, facilitating integration with systems like ERP, CRM, or other custom business systems to achieve advanced business processes and automation.
- **Combining IoT with GIS Technology**: PostgreSQL offers GIS data storage and querying capabilities, supporting geospatial indexing, geofencing and alerts, real-time location tracking, and geographical data processing, among others. Combined with EMQX's reliable message transmission capability, it can efficiently process and analyze geographical location information from mobile devices such as vehicles, enabling real-time monitoring, intelligent decision-making, and business optimization.
- **Runtime Metrics**: Support for viewing runtime metrics of each data bridge, such as total message count, success/failure counts, current rates, and more.

Through flexible event handling, extensive message transformation, flexible data operations, and real-time monitoring and analysis capabilities, you can build efficient, reliable, and scalable IoT applications, benefiting your business decisions and optimizations.

## Before You Start

This section describes the preparations you need to complete before you start to create the PostgreSQL Database data bridges, including how to set up the PostgreSQL server and create data tables.

### Prerequisites

- Knowledge about EMQX data integration [rules](./rules.md)
- Knowledge about [Data Integration](./data-bridges.md)

### Install PostgreSQL

Install PostgreSQL via Docker, and then run the docker image. 

```bash
# To start the PostgreSQL docker image and set the password as public
docker run --name PostgreSQL -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=public -d postgres

# Access the container
docker exec -it PostgreSQL bash

# Locate the PostgreSQL server in the container and input the preset password
psql -U postgres -W

# Create and then select the database

CREATE DATABASE emqx_data;

\c emqx_data;
```

### Create Data Tables

Use the following SQL statements to create data table `t_mqtt_msg` in PostgreSQL database for storing the client ID, topic, payload, and creating time of every message. 

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE t_mqtt_msg (
    id SERIAL primary key,
    msgid character varying(64),
    sender character varying(64),
    topic character varying(255),
    qos integer,
    retain integer,
    payload text,
    arrived timestamp without time zone
  );
  ```

Use the following SQL statements to create data table `emqx_client_events` in PostgreSQL database for storing the client ID, event type, and creating time of every event. 

```sql
CREATE TABLE emqx_client_events (
  id SERIAL primary key,
  clientid VARCHAR(255),
  event VARCHAR(255),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Create PostgreSQL Data Bridges

This section demonstrates how to create PostgreSQL data bridges in EMQX Dashboard. It assumes that you run both EMQX and PostgreSQL on the local machine. If you have PostgreSQL and EMQX running remotely, adjust the settings accordingly.

You need to create 2 data bridges to PostgreSQL for messages storage and event records respectively. 

### Message storage

1. Go to EMQX Dashboard, and click **Integration** -> **Connector**.

2. Click **Create** on the top right corner of the page.

3. In the **Create Connector** page, click to select **PostgreSQL**, and then click **Next**.

4. Input a name for the data bridge. The name should be a combination of upper/lower case letters and numbers.

5. Input the connection information:

   - **Server Host**: Input `127.0.0.1:5432`, or the actual hostname if the PostgreSQL server is running remotely.
   - **Database Name**: Input `emqx_data`.
   - **Username**: Input `postgres`.
   - **Password**: Input `public`.

6. Configure the **SQL Template**. Use the SQL statements below to insert data. 

   Note: This is a preprocessed SQL, so the fields should not be enclosed in quotation marks, and do not write a semicolon at the end of the statements. 

  ```sql
  INSERT INTO t_mqtt_msg(msgid, sender, topic, qos, payload, arrived) VALUES(
    ${id},
    ${clientid},
    ${topic},
    ${qos},
    ${payload},
    TO_TIMESTAMP((${timestamp} :: bigint)/1000)
  )
  ```

7. Advanced settings (optional):  Choose whether to use **sync** or **async** query mode as needed. For details, see [Configuration](./data-bridges.md#configuration).
8. Before clicking **Create**, you can click **Test Connectivity** to test that the bridge can connect to the PostgreSQL server.
9. Then click **Create** to finish the creation of the data bridge.

### Online/Offline Status Recording

The operating steps are similar to those at the [Message Storage](#message-storage) part expect for the SQL template and SQL rules. 

The SQL template for online/offline status recording is as follows. 

Note: This is a preprocessed SQL, so the fields should not be enclosed in quotation marks, and do not write a semicolon at the end of the statements.

```sql
INSERT INTO emqx_client_events(clientid, event, created_at) VALUES (
  ${clientid},
  ${event},
  TO_TIMESTAMP((${timestamp} :: bigint)/1000)
)
```

Now the PostgreSQL data bridge should appear in the data bridge list (**Integration** -> **Data Bridge**) with **Resource Status** as **Connected**. 

## Create Rules for PostgreSQL Data Bridge 

After you have successfully created the data bridge to PostgreSQL, you can continue to create rules to specify the data to be saved into PostgreSQL and rules for the online/offline status recording. 

### Message Storage

1. Go to EMQX Dashboard, click **Integration** -> **Rules**.

2. Click **Create** on the top right corner of the page.

3. Input `my_rule` as the rule ID, and set the rules in the **SQL Editor**. Here we want to save the MQTT messages under topic `t/#`  to PostgreSQL, we can use the SQL syntax below. 

   Note: If you want to specify your own SQL syntax, make sure that you have included all fields required by the data bridge in the `SELECT` part. 

  ```sql
SELECT 
  *
FROM
  "t/#"
  ```

4. Then click the **Add Action** button, select **Forwarding with Data Bridge** from the dropdown list and then select the data bridge we just created under **Data bridge**.  
5. Then, click the **Add** button. 
6. Then click the **Create** button to finish the setup. 

### Online/Offline Status Recording

The creating steps are similar to those at the [Message Storage](#message-storage) part except for the SQL rules.

The SQL rule is as follows: 

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM 
  "$events/client_connected", "$events/client_disconnected"
```

Now you have successfully created the data bridge to PostgreSQL. You can click **Integration** -> **Flow Designer** to view the topology. It can be seen that the messages under topic `t/#`  are sent and saved to PostgreSQL after parsing by rule  `my_rule`. 

## Test Data Bridges and Rules

Use MQTTX  to send a message to topic  `t/1`  to trigger an online/offline event. 

```bash
mqttx pub -i emqx_c -t t/1 -m '{ "msg": "hello PostgreSQL" }'
```

Check the running status of the two data bridges, there should be one new incoming and one new outgoing message. 

Check whether the data is written into the `t_mqtt_msg` data table.

```bash
emqx_data=# select * from t_mqtt_msg;
 id |              msgid               | sender | topic | qos | retain |            payload
        |       arrived
----+----------------------------------+--------+-------+-----+--------+-------------------------------+---------------------
  1 | 0005F298A0F0AEE2F443000012DC0002 | emqx_c | t/1   |   0 |        | { "msg": "hello PostgreSQL" } | 2023-01-19 07:10:32
(1 row)

```

Check whether the data is written into the`emqx_client_events` table.

```bash
emqx_data=# select * from emqx_client_events;
 id | clientid |        event        |     created_at
----+----------+---------------------+---------------------
  3 | emqx_c   | client.connected    | 2023-01-19 07:10:32
  4 | emqx_c   | client.disconnected | 2023-01-19 07:10:32
(2 rows)

```
