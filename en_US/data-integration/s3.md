## How It Works

Amazon S3 data integration in EMQX is a ready-to-use feature that can be easily configured for complex business development. In a typical IoT application, EMQX acts as the IoT platform responsible for device connectivity and message transmission, while Amazon S3 serves as the data storage platform, handling message data storage.

EMQX utilizes rules engines and Sinks to forward device events and data to Amazon S3. Applications can read data from Amazon S3 for further data applications. The specific workflow is as follows:

1. **Device Connection to EMQX**: IoT devices trigger an online event upon successfully connecting via the MQTT protocol. The event includes device ID, source IP address, and other property information.
2. **Device Message Publishing and Receiving**: Devices publish telemetry and status data through specific topics. EMQX receives the messages and compares them within the rules engine.
3. **Rules Engine Processing Messages**: The built-in rules engine processes messages and events from specific sources based on topic matching. It matches corresponding rules and processes messages and events, such as data format transformation, filtering specific information, or enriching messages with context information.
4. **Writing to Amazon S3**: The rule triggers an action to write the message to S3. With the Amazon S3 Sink, users can extract data from the rules processing results and send it to Amazon S3, realizing message content storage. The stored objects can be in text format or binary format, depending on the message content and Sink configuration.

After events and message data are written to Amazon S3, you can connect to Amazon S3 to read the data for flexible application development, such as:

- Data archiving: Store device messages as objects in Amazon S3 for long-term preservation to meet regulatory requirements or business needs.
- Data analysis: Import data from S3 into analytics services like Snowflake for predictive maintenance, device efficiency evaluation, and other data analysis services.

## Features and Advantages

Using Amazon S3 data integration in EMQX can bring the following features and advantages to your business:

- **Message Transformation**: Messages can undergo extensive processing and transformation in EMQX rules before being written to Amazon S3, facilitating subsequent storage and use.
- **Flexible Data Operations**: With the S3 Sink, specific fields of data can be conveniently written into Amazon S3 buckets, supporting the dynamic setting of bucket and object keys for flexible data storage.
- **Integrated Business Processes**: The S3 Sink allows device data to be combined with the rich ecosystem applications of Amazon S3, enabling more business scenarios like data analysis and archiving.
- **Low-Cost Long-Term Storage**: Compared to databases, Amazon S3 offers a highly available, reliable, and cost-effective object storage service, suitable for long-term storage needs.

These features enable you to build efficient, reliable, and scalable IoT applications and benefit from business decisions and optimizations.

## Before You Start

This section introduces the preparations required before creating an Amazon S3 Sink in EMQX.

### Prerequisites

- Understanding of [rules](./rules.md).
- Understanding of [data integration](./data-bridges.md).

### Prepare the S3 Bucket

EMQX supports Amazon S3 and other S3-compatible storage services. You can use AWS cloud services or deploy a MinIO instance with Docker.

::: tab Amazon S3

TODO

:::

::: tab MinIO

1. Install and start MinIO with Docker:

```bash
docker run \
   -p 9000:9000 \
   -p 9001:9001 \
   --name minio \
   -e "MINIO_ROOT_USER=admin" \
   -e "MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=MyMinIOPassword" \
   minio/minio:RELEASE.2024-02-17T01-15-57Z.fips \
   server /data --console-address ":9001"
```

Port `9000` is for the S3 API, and port `9001` is for the MinIO management interface.

After starting MinIO, you can access the MinIO console through a browser at `http://localhost:9001` using the login credentials `admin` and `MyMinIOPassword`.

1. Create a bucket:

In the MinIO console, navigate to **Administrator** -> **Buckets**, enter the storage bucket management page, click the `Create Bucket +` button in the top right corner, input `iot-data`, and click `Create Bucket` to finish the bucket creation.

1. Create access keys:

In the MinIO console, navigate to **User** -> **Access Keys**, enter the Access Keys page, click the `Create access key +` button in the top right corner, input the Access Key and Secret Key, then click `Create` to finish creating the access keys.

With MinIO installed and configured, we're now ready to create the Amazon S3 Sink in EMQX.

## Create a Connector

Before adding the S3 Sink, you need to create the corresponding connector.

Using MinIO as an example, assuming you are running EMQX and MinIO on the same local machine, the creation steps are as follows:

1. Go to the Dashboard **Integration** -> **Connector** page.
2. Click the **Create** button in the top right corner.
3. Select **Amazon S3** as the connector type and click next.
4. Enter the connector name, a combination of upper and lowercase letters and numbers. Here, enter `my-s3`.
5. Enter the MinIO connection information, **Host** as `127.0.0.1`, **Port** as `9000`, and the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** as the access keys created in MinIO.
6. Click the **Create** button at the bottom to complete the connector creation.

You have now completed the connector creation and will proceed to create a rule and Sink specifying the data to be written.

## Create an Amazon S3 Sink Rule

This section demonstrates how to create a rule in EMQX to process messages from the source MQTT topic `t/#` and write the processed results to the `iot-data` bucket in S3 through the configured Sink.

1. Go to the Dashboard **Integration** -> **Rules** page.

2. Click the **Create** button in the top right corner.

3. Enter the rule ID `my_rule`, and input the following rule SQL in the SQL editor:

   ```sql
   SELECT
     *
   FROM
       "t/#"
   ```
   
   ::: tip
   
   If you are new to SQL, you can click **SQL Examples** and **Enable Debug** to learn and test the rule SQL results.
   
   :::
   
4. Add an action, select Amazon S3 from the **Action Type** dropdown list, keep the action dropdown as the default `create action` option, or choose a previously created Amazon S3 action from the action dropdown. Here, create a new Sink and add it to the rule.

5. Fill in the Sink name and description in the form below.

6. Select the `my-s3` connector created earlier from the connector dropdown. You can also click the create button next to the dropdown to quickly create a new connector in the pop-up box. The required configuration parameters can be found in [Create a Connector](#create-a-connector).

7. Set the **Bucket**, input `iot-data`. This field also supports `${var}` format placeholders, but ensure the corresponding name bucket is created in S3 in advance.

8. Choose **ACL** as needed, specifying the access permission for the uploaded object.

9. Set the **Object Key**. The object key defines the location of the object to be uploaded to the bucket. It supports `${var}` format placeholders and can use `/` to specify storage directories. It's also usually necessary to set the object's suffix for management and distinction purposes. Here, enter `msgs/${clientid}_${timestamp}.json`, where `${clientid}` is the client ID and `${timestamp}` is the message timestamp. This ensures that each device's messages are written to different objects.

10. Set the **Object Content**. By default, it is a JSON text format containing all fields. It supports `${var}` format placeholders. Here, we input `${payload}` to indicate using the message body as the object content. In this case, the object's storage format will depend on the message body's format, supporting compressed packages, images, or other binary formats.

11. Expand **Advanced Settings** and configure the advanced setting options as needed (optional). For more details, refer to [Advanced Settings](#advanced-settings).

12. Use the default values for the remaining parameters. Click the **Create** button to complete the Sink creation. After successful creation, the page will return to the rule creation, and the new Sink will be added to the rule actions.

13. Back on the rule creation page, click the **Create** button to complete the entire rule creation process.

You have now successfully created the rule. You can see the newly created rule on the **Rules** page and the new S3 Sink on the **Actions (Sink)** tab.

You can also click **Integration** -> **Flow Designer** to view the topology. The topology visually shows how messages under the topic `t/#` are written into S3 after being parsed by the rule `my_rule`.

## Test the Rule

Use MQTTX to publish a message to the topic `t/1`:

```bash
mqttx pub -i emqx_c -t t/1 -m '{ "msg": "hello S3" }'
```

After sending a few messages, access the MinIO console and open the `iot-data` bucket. You should see the messages you published successfully written into the MinIO `msgs` directory:

## Advanced Settings

This section delves into the advanced configuration options available for the S3 Sink. In the Dashboard, when configuring the Sink, you can expand **Advanced Settings** to adjust the following parameters based on your specific needs.

| Field Name                         | Description                                                  | Default Value  |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| **Buffer Pool Size**               | Specifies the number of buffer worker processes, which are allocated to manage the data flow between EMQX and S3. These workers temporarily store and process data before sending it to the target service, crucial for optimizing performance and ensuring smooth data transmission. | `16`           |
| **Health Check Interval**          | Specifies the time interval (in seconds) for the Sink to perform automatic health checks on its connection with S3. | `15`           |
| **Buffer Queue Maximum Length**    | Specifies the maximum number of bytes that can be buffered by each buffer worker process in the S3 Sink. The buffer workers temporarily store data before sending it to S3, acting as intermediaries to handle the data stream more efficiently. Adjust this value based on system performance and data transmission requirements. | `256MB`        |
| **Request Mode**                   | Allows you to choose between `synchronous` or `asynchronous` request modes to optimize message transmission according to different requirements. In asynchronous mode, writing to S3 does not block the MQTT message publishing process. However, this may lead to clients receiving messages before they arrive at S3. | `Asynchronous` |
| **Request In-flight Queue Window** | "In-flight queue requests" refer to requests that have been initiated but have not yet received a response or acknowledgment. This setting controls the maximum number of in-flight queue requests that can exist simultaneously during Sink communication with S3. <br/>When **Request Mode** is set to `asynchronous`, the "Request In-flight Queue Window" parameter becomes particularly important. If strict sequential processing of messages from the same MQTT client is crucial, then this value should be set to `1`. | `100`          |
