[HStreamDB](https://hstream.io/) is an open-source streaming data platform that enables you to efficiently ingest, store, process, and distribute all real-time messages, events, and other data streams in one unified platform. Through EMQX's integration with HStreamDB, you can save MQTT messages and client events to HStreamDB, achieving large-scale IoT data collection, transmission, and storage, and enabling real-time processing, monitoring, and analysis of data streams using standard SQL and materialized views.

This page provides a comprehensive introduction to the data integration between EMQX and HStreamDB with practical instructions on creating and validating the data integration.

## How It Works

HStreamDB data bridge is an out-of-the-box feature of EMQX that combines EMQX's device connectivity and message transmission capabilities with HStreamDB's robust data storage and processing capabilities. With the built-in rule engine component, the data streaming and processing process is simplified between the two platforms.

The diagram below illustrates a typical architecture of data integration between EMQX and HStreamDB:

![EMQX Integration HStreamDB](./assets/emqx-integration-hstreamdb.png)

EMQX forwards MQTT data to HStreamDB through the rule engine and configured data bridge, and the complete process is as follows:

1. **Message publication and reception**: IoT devices establish successful connections through the MQTT protocol and subsequently publish telemetry and status data to specific topics. When EMQX receives these messages, it initiates the matching process within its rules engine.
2. **Rule engine processes messages**: Using the built-in rule engine, MQTT messages from specific sources can be processed based on topic matching. The rule engine matches corresponding rules and processes messages, such as data format conversion, filtering specific information, or enriching messages with context information.
3. **Data streaming into HStreamDB**: Rule triggers the action of forwarding messages to HStreamDB where data can be easily configured to HStreamDB stream name, partition key and record, facilitating subsequent data processing and analysis.

After MQTT message data is written to Apache HStreamDB, you can engage in flexible application development, such as:

- Upon receiving specific MQTT messages, you can use HStreamDB's rule engine component to trigger corresponding actions or events, enabling cross-system and application event-driven functionality.
- Analyze MQTT data streams in real-time within HStreamDB, detect anomalies or specific event patterns, and trigger alert notifications or perform corresponding actions based on these conditions.
- Centralize data from multiple MQTT topics into a unified data stream and utilize HStreamDB's computational capabilities for real-time aggregation, calculation, and analysis to gain more comprehensive data insights.

## Features and Benefits

The data integration with HStreamDB brings the following features and advantages to your business:

- **Reliable IoT Data Message Delivery**: EMQX can reliably batch and send MQTT messages to HStreamDB, enabling the integration of IoT devices with HStreamDB and application systems.
- **MQTT Message Transformation**: Using the rule engine, EMQX can filter and transform MQTT messages. Messages can undergo data extraction, filtering, enrichment, and transformation before being sent to HStreamDB.
- **Large-Scale Data Stream Storage**: HStreamDB supports the reliable storage of millions of data streams in a specially designed distributed, fault-tolerant log storage cluster. It can replay or push real-time data stream updates to applications as needed. Perfectly integrating with EMQX's message model, it achieves large-scale IoT data collection, transmission, and storage.
- **Cluster and Scalability**: Built with a cloud-native architecture, EMQX and HStreamDB support online scaling and dynamic expansion and contraction of clusters, allowing flexible horizontal scaling to meet growing business demands.
- **Flexible Processing Capabilities**: In HStreamDB, you can use familiar SQL to filter, transform, aggregate, and join multiple data streams. It also supports real-time processing, monitoring, and analysis of data streams using standard SQL and materialized views, providing real-time data insights.
- **Processing Capabilities in High-Throughput Scenarios**: HStreamDB Data Bridge supports both synchronous and asynchronous write modes, allowing for a flexible balance between latency and throughput according to different scenarios.

## Before You Start

This section describes the preparations you need to complete before you start to create a HStreamDB data bridge, including how to start HStreamDB services and create streams.

The sub-sections below describe how to install and connect to HStreamDB on Linux/MacOS using Docker images. Make sure you have installed Docker and use Docker Compose v2 if possible. For other installation methods of HStreamDB and HStreamDB Platform, please refer to [Quickstart with Docker-Compose](https://docs.hstream.io/start/quickstart-with-docker.html) and [Getting Started with HStream Platform](https://docs.hstream.io/start/try-out-hstream-platform.html).

### Prerequisites

- Knowledge about EMQX data integration [rules](./rules.md)
- Knowledge about [Data Integration](./data-bridges.md)

### Start HStreamDB TCP Service and Create Streams

This section describes how to start a single-node HStreamDB TCP service in your local Docker environment and then create Streams in HStreamDB.

::: Note

Once HStreamDB resources are in a connected state, if you perform operations on Streams in HStreamDB, such as deleting and recreating a Stream, you need to reconnect to HStreamDB, which means restarting HStreamDB resources.

:::

1. Create a `docker-compose-tcp.yaml` file with the following contents.

### Start HStreamDB TLS Service and Create Streams

This section describes how to start a dual-node HStreamDB TCP service in your local Docker environment and then create Streams in HStreamDB.

::: Note

Once HStreamDB resources are in a connected state, if you perform operations on Streams in HStreamDB, such as deleting and recreating a Stream, you need to reconnect to HStreamDB, which means restarting HStreamDB resources.

:::tip About Docker Network Environment and Certificate Files

- This Docker Compose file uses the `172.100.0.0/24` network subnet as the Docker network bridge. If you have other network configuration requirements, please modify the Docker Compose file accordingly.
- Please be aware not to set default environment variables like `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, `all_proxy`, etc., for containers, as these environment variables may affect communication between different containers in HStream in the current version. Refer to [_Docker Network Proxy_](https://docs.docker.com/network/proxy/).
- Root certificates and self-signed certificates are generated automatically using the [_smallstep/step-ca_](https://hub.docker.com/r/smallstep/step-ca) container and are configured with two subject alternate names, `172.100.0.10` and `172.100.0.11`.
- If you have other certificate requirements, please mount the certificate files into the HStreamDB container yourself or refer to [_Configuring step-ca_](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-ca/configuration/index.html).
  - Certificates generated by step-ca under default settings are only valid for one day. If you want to change the certificate validity period, delete the certificates in the `ca` directory and modify the certificate validity according to [_step-ca-configuration-options_](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-ca/configuration/#configuration-options).

:::

1. Create a directory `tls-deploy/ca` to store certificates.

   ```bash
   mkdir tls-deploy/ca
   ```

2. Create a `docker-compose-tcp.yaml` file with the following contents under `tls-deploy`.

Now the directory structure should be:

   ```bash
   $ tree tls-deploy
   tls-deploy
   ├── ca
   └── docker-compose-tls.yaml

   2 directories, 1 file
   ```

3. Enter the directory `tls-deploy` and run the following shell command to start an HStreamDB TLS service.

   ```bash
   env step_ca=$PWD/ca docker compose -f docker-compose-tls.yaml up --build
   ```

4. Enter HStreamDB container and create to Streams named `mqtt_connect` and `mqtt_message`.
   :::tip TLS connection command options

   Similar to the HStreamDB TCP service, here you only need to add the `--tls-ca [CA_PATH]` option to the command line. Please note that if you want to execute the command on node `quickstart-tls-hserver-1`, you need to specify the `--port 6572` option additionally to ensure consistency with the port specified in the docker-compose file.

## Create Connector

This section introduces how to create HStreamDB data bridges in EMQX Dashboard. Data bridges for client message storage and event recording require different SQL templates. Therefore, you need to create 2 different data bridges for message storage and event recording.

The demonstration in this section assumes you run EMQX and HStreaDB in docker on the local machine. If you have HStreamDB and EMQX running remotely, please adjust the settings accordingly.

1. Go to EMQX Dashboard, click **Integration** -> **Connector**.

2. Click **Create** on the top right corner of the page.

3. In the **Create Connector** page, click to select **HStreamDB**, and then click **Next**.

4. Enter a name for the data bridge. The name should be a combination of upper/lower case letters and numbers.

5. Enter the HStreamDB connection information. Fill in the required fields (marked with an asterisk).

   - **HStreamDB Server URL**: `hstream://127.0.0.1:6570`, or use the actual HStreamDB address and port.
     - Scheme supports `http`, `https`, `hstream`, and `hstreams`.
     - For TLS connection, scheme needs to be `hstreams` or `https`, for example `hstreams://127.0.0.1:6570`.
   - **HStreamDB Stream Name**: Enter the name of the Streams you created before.
     - For client message storage, enter `mqtt_message`.
     - For event recording, enter `mqtt_connect`.
   - **HStreamDB Partition Key**: Sepecify the partition key that is used to determine where data will be stored within the HStreamDB's various partitions or nodes. For example, you can enter `${topic]}` to ensure that messages of the same topic are written into HStreamDB in order. If not specified, a default key is used and data will be mapped to some default shard.
   - **HStreamDB gRPC Timeout**: Specify the maximum amount of time the system will wait for a response from the HStreamDB server when a gRPC request is made. The default value is `30` second.
   - **Enable TLS**: You can click the toggle switch to enable the TLS connection if required. When TLS is enabled, disable **TLS Verify**. Upload the certificates and key generated under the `tls-deploy/ca` directory:
     - Upload `ca/hstream.crt` to **TLS Cert**.
     - Upload `ca/hstream.key` to **TLS Key**.
     - Upload `ca/certs/root_ca.crt` to **CA Cert**.

6. Configure **HStream Record Template** according to your business needs:

   - To create a data bridge for forwarding messages to the specific topic, use the template below for data insert:

     ```json
     {"id": ${id}, "topic": "${topic}", "qos": ${qos}, "payload": "${payload}"}
     ```

   - To create a data bridge for online/offline status recording, use the following SQL statement for data insert:

     ```json
     {"clientid": "${clientid}", "event_type": "${event}", "event_time": ${timestamp}}
     ```

7. Advanced settings (optional):  Choose whether to use **sync** or **async** query mode as needed. For details, see [Configuration](./data-bridges.md).

8. Before clicking **Create**, you can click **Test Connectivity** to test that the bridge can connect to HStreamDB.

9. Click **Create** to finish the creation of the data bridge.

   A confirmation dialog will appear and ask if you like to create a rule using this data bridge, you can click **Create Rule** to continue creating rules to specify the data to be saved into HStreamDB. You can also create rules by following the steps in [Create Rules for HStreamDB Data Bridge](#create-rules-for-hstreamdb-data-bridge).

Now the HStream data bridge should appear in the data bridge list (**Integration** -> **Connector**) with **Resource Status** as **Connected**.

## Create Connector

After you have successfully created the data bridge to HStreamDB, you can continue to create rules to specify the data to be saved into HStreamDB and rules for the online/offline status recording.

1. Go to EMQX Dashboard, click **Integration** -> **Rules**.

2. Click **Create** on the top right corner of the page.

3. Input `my_rule` as the rule ID, and set the rules in the **SQL Editor** based on the feature to use:

   - To create a rule for message storage, input the following statement, which means the MQTT messages under topic `t/#`  will be saved to HStreamDB.

     Note: If you want to specify your own SQL syntax, make sure that you have included all fields required by the data bridge in the `SELECT` part.

     ```sql
     SELECT
       *
     FROM
       "t/#"
     ```

   - To create a rule for online/offline status recording, input the following statement:

     ```sql
     SELECT
       *
     FROM
       "$events/client_connected", "$events/client_disconnected"
     ```

4. Click the **Add Action** button, select **Forwarding with Data Bridge** from the dropdown list and then select the data bridge we just created under **Data Bridge**. Click the **Add** button.
5. Click the **Create** button to finish the setup.

Now you have successfully created the rule for HStreamDB data bridge. You can click **Integration** -> **Flow Designer** to view the topology. It can be seen that the messages under topic `t/#`  are sent and saved to HStreamDB after parsing by rule  `my_rule`.

## Test Rule

Use MQTTX  to send a message to topic  `t/1`  to trigger an online/offline event.

```bash
mqttx pub -i emqx_c -t t/1 -m '{ "msg": "Hello HStreamDB" }'
```

Check the running status of the two data bridges.

- In the data bridge for message storage, there should be one new incoming and one new outgoing message. Check whether the data is written into the Stream ` mqtt_messages`:

```bash
# Enter `Control-C` to stop after reading Stream `mqtt_message`
root@9c7ce2f51860:/# hstream stream read-stream mqtt_message
timestamp: "1693903488278", id: 1947758763121538-8589934593-0, key: "", record: {"id": 00060498A3B3C4F8F4400100127E0002, "topic": "t/1", "qos": 0, "payload": { "msg": "Hello HStreamDB" }}
^CRead Done.
```

- For the data bridge used to record online/offline status, there should be two new events recorded: client connected and client disconnected. Check whether the status recording is written into the Stream `mqtt_connect`:

```bash
# Enter `Control-C` to stop after reading Stream `mqtt_connect`
root@9c7ce2f51860:/# hstream stream read-stream mqtt_connect
timestamp: "1693903488274", id: 1947758827604597-8589934593-0, key: "", record: {"clientid": "emqx_c", "event_type": "client.connected", "event_time": 1693903488266}
timestamp: "1693903488294", id: 1947758827604597-8589934594-0, key: "", record: {"clientid": "emqx_c", "event_type": "client.disconnected", "event_time": 1693903488271}
^CRead Done.
```
