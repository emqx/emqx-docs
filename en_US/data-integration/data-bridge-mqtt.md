# Bridge MQTT Data into MQTT Broker

The MQTT data bridge is a channel for EMQX to communicate with other MQTT services, including EMQX clusters that use the MQTT protocol. This page introduces how the MQTT data bridge works in EMQX and provides a quick start tutorial on how to create an MQTT data bridge in EMQX Dashboard or using the configuration file.

## How MQTT Data Bridge Works

EMQX supports the MQTT data bridge that works in two primary modes: ingress and egress. The following sections explain how each mode works. Also, this section introduces the concept of connection pools used in both modes.

The diagram below illustrates a typical architecture of data integration between EMQX and HStreamDB:

### Ingress Mode

In ingress mode, the local EMQX subscribes to the topics from the bridged remote MQTT brokers and distributes the received messages within the current cluster. Below is the message flow in **ingress** direction:

The MQTT data bridge can be used either alone or in conjunction with rules for more powerful and flexible data processing capabilities. In **ingress** direction, the data bridge can be used as the data source of the rule. The message flow for MQTT data bridge working with rules is as follows:

### Egress Mode

In egress mode, the local EMQX forwards messages from the current cluster to the bridged remote MQTT brokers following the rule settings. And this is the message flow in **egress** direction:

Similar to the ingress mode, the MQTT data bridge can also be used in conjunction with rules. In **egress** direction, the data bridge can be used as the action of the rule:

### Connection Pool

EMQX allows more than one client to connect to the bridged MQTT broker at the same time. When creating the data bridge, you can set a pool of MQTT client connections and configure the pool size indicating the number of the client connections in the pool. Enabling connection pool allows for efficient utilization of server resources, leading to greater message throughput.

Because the MQTT protocol requires that a client connecting to the broker must have its own unique Client ID, EMQX automatically generates the Client ID for each client in the connection pool following the pattern below:

```bash
[${ClientIDPrefix}:]${BridgeName}:${Mode}:${NodeName}:${N}
```

| Fragment            | Description                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `${ClientIDPrefix}` | Prefix of the client ID as configured. If not set then whole first fragment is omitted. |
| `${BridgeName}`     | User-provided name of the bridge.                            |
| `${Mode}`           | Either `ingress` or `egress`.                                |
| `${NodeName}`       | [Name of the node](../configuration/cluster.md#node-names) on which the MQTT client is running. |
| `${N}`              | Number from `1` to the configured size of the connection pool. |

#### Use Connection Pool in Ingress Mode

Although the connection pool applies to both ingress and egress modes, using the connection pool in ingress mode should consider a few caveats. When you have EMQX [cluster](../deploy/cluster/introduction.md) with more than 1 node, and configures an ingress MQTT bridge to subscribe non-shared topics from the remote broker, clients in the connection pool will receive duplicated messages if they all subscribe to the same topic. In that case, it will bring pressure to the brokers, so it is strongly advised to use [shared subscription](../messaging/mqtt-shared-subscription.md) as a kind of safety measure. For example, you can configure the topic of the remote MQTT Broker to `$share/name1/topic1` or `$share/name2/topic2/#` if topic filter is used. In non-shared subscription cases, the MQTT client connection pool will be downscaled to one client, which means only one client will be started.

## Features and Benefits

The MQTT data bridge has the following features and benefits:

- **Extensive Compatibility**: The MQTT data bridge uses the standard MQTT protocol, allowing it to bridge to various IoT platforms, including AWS IoT Core, Azure IoT Hubs, and also supports open-source or other industry MQTT brokers and IoT platforms. This enables seamless integration and communication with a variety of devices and platforms.
- **Bidirectional Data Flow**: It supports bidirectional data flow, enabling the publishing of messages from EMQX locally to remote MQTT services, and also subscribing to messages from MQTT services and publishing them locally. This bidirectional communication capability makes data transfer between different systems more flexible and controllable.
- **Flexible Topic Mapping**: Based on the MQTT publish-subscribe model, the MQTT data bridge implements flexible topic mapping. It supports adding prefixes to topics and dynamically constructing topics using the client's contextual information (such as client ID, username, etc.). This flexibility allows for customized processing and routing of messages according to specific needs.
- **High Performance**: The MQTT data bridge offers performance optimization features, such as connection pools and shared subscriptions, to reduce the load on individual bridge clients, achieving lower bridge latency and higher bridge message throughput. Through these optimization measures, the overall system performance and scalability can be enhanced.
- **Payload Transformation**: The MQTT data bridge allows for the processing of message payloads by defining SQL rules. This means that during message transmission, operations such as data extraction, filtering, enrichment, and transformation can be performed on the payload. For example, real-time metrics can be extracted from the payload and transformed and processed before the message is delivered to Kafka.
- **Metrics Monitoring**: The runtime metrics monitoring is provided for each data bridge. It allows viewing of total message count, success/failure counts, current rates, etc., helping users to monitor and assess the performance and health of the bridge in real time.

## Create MQTT Data Bridge via Dashboard

This section uses EMQX [public MQTT broker](https://www.emqx.com/en/mqtt/public-mqtt5-broker) as an example to demonstrate how to configure a data bridge between EMQX and this public MQTT broker in the Dashboard.

1. Go to EMQX Dashboard, and click **Integration** -> **Connector**.

2. Click **Create** in the top right corner of the page.

3. In the **Create Connector** page, click to select **MQTT**, and then click **Next**.

4. Input a name for the data bridge. The name should be a combination of upper/lower case letters or numbers, for example, `my_mqtt_bridge`.

5. Input the connection information. Input `broker.emqx.io:1883` for **MQTT Broker**. As no authentication is required from the server side, you can leave the **Username** and **Password** blank. For the other fields in this section, you can keep the default value or set it as the actual condition.

6. Set the data bridge rules with the **Ingress** or **Egress** field.

   :::tip
   You can choose to configure either the **Ingress** or **Egress** field or both fields, but at least one field should be set up. Turn on the toggle switch of the corresponding field to start the configuration.
   :::

   - **Ingress** (optional): Set the rules to forward the messages from remote MQTT brokers to local ones. In this example, you forward the messages from `remote/topic/ingress` to `local/topic/ingress`, so you first need to subscribe to the remote topic and then specify the local topics to receive the messages:
     - **Remote MQTT Broker**: Subscribe to the remote topics.
       - **Topic**: In cluster mode, you can use the shared subscription to avoid repeated messages, therefore you can fill in `$share/g/remote/topic/ingress`.
       - **QoS**: Select `0`.
       
     - **Local MQTT Broker**: Forward the received messages to specific local topics or leave them blank, then these messages will first be processed by the configured rules and then forwarded with the [republish action](./rules.md).
       - **Topic**: Input `local/topic/ingress`.
       
       - **QoS**: Select `0` or `${qos}` (to use the QoS of the received messages).
       
       - **Retain**: Confirm whether the message will be published as a retained message.
       
       - **Payload**: Payload template for the messages to be forwarded, and supports reading data using `${field}` syntax. The supported fields are as follows:
       
         | Field Name                    | Description                                                  |
         | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
         | topic                         | The topic of the source message                              |
         | server                        | The server address to which the data bridge is connected     |
         | retain                        | Whether to be published as a retain the message, with a value of false |
         | qos                           | Message Quality of Service                                      |
         | pub_props                     | MQTT 5.0 message properties object, including user property pairs, user properties, and other properties |
         | pub_props.User-Property-Pairs | Array of user property pairs, each containing key-value pairs, for example, `{"key":"foo", "value":"bar"}` |
         | pub_props.User-Property       | User property object, containing key-value pairs, for example, `{"foo":"bar"}` |
         | pub_props.*                   | Other message property key-value pairs, for example, `Content-Type: JSON` |
         | payload                       | Message content                                              |
         | message_received_at           | Message received timestamp in milliseconds                   |
         | id                            | Message ID                                                   |
         | dup                           | Whether it is a duplicate message                            |
       
         For example, when the message template is left blank, the following message will be published:
       
         ```json
         {
           "topic": "f/1",
           "server": "broker.emqx.io:1883",
           "retain": false,
           "qos": 0,
           "pub_props": {
               "User-Property-Pairs": [
                   {
                       "value": "bar",
                       "key": "foo"
                   }
               ],
               "User-Property": {
                   "foo": "bar"
               },
               "Message-Expiry-Interval": 3600,
               "Content-Type": "JSON"
           },
           "payload": "Hello MQTTX CLI",
           "message_received_at": 1699603701552,
           "id": "000609C7D2E3D556F445000010E4000C",
           "dup": false
         }
         ```
       
     - **Connection Pool Size**: Specifies the size of the pool of MQTT client connections to the local broker. In this example, you can set `8`. This is safe as long as shared subscription is used for the remote topic.
     
   - **Egress** (optional): Set the rules to publish messages from specific local MQTT topics to remote MQTT brokers. In this example, you publish the messages from `local/topic/egress` to `remote/topic/egress`:

   - **Local MQTT Broker**: Specify the local message topics.
       - **Topic**: Input `local/topic/egress`.
     
   - **Remote MQTT Broker**: Specify the target topics on the remote broker.
       - **Topic**: Input `remote/topic/egress`.
       - **QoS**: Select `0` or `${qos}` (to use the QoS of the received messages).
       - **Retain**: Confirm whether the message will be published as a retained message.
       - **Payload**: Payload template for the messages to be forwarded, and Supports reading data using `${field}` syntax.
     
   - **MQTT Client Pool Size**: Specifies the size of the pool of MQTT client connections to the local broker. In this example, you can set `8`.

7. In **Query mode** field, you can configure whether to use sync/async mode and your buffer pool size as your business needs.

8. Before clicking **Create**, you can click **Test Connectivity** to test that the bridge can connect to the MQTT broker.

9. Click **Create** to finish the creation of the data bridge.

## Create MQTT Data Bridge via Configuration File

EMQX also supports to use the configuration file to create an MQTT data bridge. This section uses EMQX [public MQTT broker](https://www.emqx.com/en/mqtt/public-mqtt5-broker) as an example to demonstrate how to configure a data bridge between EMQX and this public MQTT broker in the configuration file. The example code is as follows:

```bash
bridges.mqtt.my_mqtt_bridge {
  enable = true
  server = "broker.emqx.io:1883"
  username = "emqx_u"
  password = "public"
  proto_ver = "v4"
  clean_start = true
  keepalive = "60s"

  egress {
    local {topic = "local/topic/egress"}
    remote {
      payload = "${payload}"
      qos = 1
      retain = true
      topic = "remote/topic/egress"
    }
    pool_size = 8
  }
  ingress {
    local {
      topic = "$share/g/remote/topic/ingress"
      qos = 1
      payload = "${payload}"
    }
    remote {qos = 1, topic = "local/topic/ingress"}
    pool_size = 8
  }
}
```
