# Bridge Data into MQTT Broker

The MQTT data bridge is a channel for EMQX to communicate with other MQTT services that speak the MQTT protocol, including EMQX clusters. Two primary modes are supported:

- **Ingress** mode

    Subscribing to the topics of the bridged brokers to distribute the received messages within the current cluster.

- **Egress** mode

    Forwarding messages from the current cluster to the bridged brokers following the rule settings.

The following topic mapping configuration is used here to implement message bridging between local and remote MQTT services:

| Topic                      | Direction                       | Target topic              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **`remote/topic/ingress`** | **`ingress`** (remote -> local) | **`local/topic/ingress`** |
| **`local/topic/egress`**   | **`egress`** (local -> remote)  | **`remote/topic/egress`** |

Below is the message flow in **ingress** direction:

And this is the message flow in **egress** direction:

MQTT data bridge can be used either alone or in conjunction with rules for more powerful and flexible data processing capabilities.

The message flow for MQTT data bridge working with rules are as follows:

In **ingress** direction, it can be used as the data source of the rule:

In **egress** direction, it can be used as the action of the rule:

<img src="./assets/bridge_egress_rule.png" alt="bridge_egress_rule" style="zoom: 50%;" />

In both modes EMQX employs pools of MQTT clients to connect to the bridged brokers, in order to achieve high throughput and make use of available parallelism.

## Quick Start Tutorial

The following section will use EMQX [public MQTT broker](https://www.emqx.com/en/mqtt/public-mqtt5-broker) as an example to illustrate how to configure a data bridge between EMQX and this public MQTT broker.

### Create MQTT Data Bridge via Dashboard

1. Go to EMQX Dashboard, and click **Data Integration** -> **Data Bridge**.

2. Click **Create** in the top right corner of the page.

3. In the **Create Data Bridge** page, click to select **MQTT**, and then click **Next**.

4. Input a name for the data bridge. The name should be a combination of upper/lower case letters or numbers, for example, `my_mqtt_bridge`.

5. Input the connection information. Input `broker.emqx.io:1883` for **MQTT Broker**. As no authentication is required from the server side, you can leave the **Username** and **Password** blank. For the other fields in this section, you can keep the default value or set it as the actual condition.

6. Set the data bridge rules with the **Ingress** or **Egress** field.

   :::tip
   You can choose to configure either the **Ingress** or **Egress** field or both fields, but at least one field should be set up. Turn on the toggle switch of the corresponding field to start the configuration.
   :::

   - **Ingress** (optional): Set the rules to forward the messages from remote MQTT brokers to local ones. In this example, we want to forward the messages from `remote/topic/ingress` to `local/topic/ingress`, so we will first subscribe to the remote topic and then specify the local topics to receive the messages:
     - **Remote MQTT Broker**: Subscribe to the remote topics.
     
       - **Topic**: In cluster mode, we can use the [Shared Subscription](../mqtt/mqtt-shared-subscription.md) to avoid repeated messages, therefore we will fill in `$share/g/remote/topic/ingress`
       - **QoS**: Select `0`.
     
     - **Local MQTT Broker**: Forward the received messages to specific local topics or leave them blank, then these messages will first be processed by the configured rules and then forwarded with the [republish action](./rules.md).
       - **Topic**: Input `local/topic/ingress`.
       - **QoS**: Select `0` or `${qos}` (to use the QoS of the received messages).
       - **Retain**: Confirm whether the message will be published as a retained message.
       - **Payload**: Payload template for the messages to be forwarded, and Supports reading data using `${field}` syntax.

     - **Pool size**: Introduced in 5.1, this option specifies the size of the pool of MQTT clients that will ingest messages from the remote broker, we'll set `8` to make use of available parallelism. This is safe as long as shared subscription is used for the remote topic.
     
   - **Egress** (optional): Set the rules to publish messages from specific local MQTT topics to remote MQTT brokers. In this example, we want to publish the messages from `local/topic/egress` to `remote/topic/egress`:
   
     - **Local MQTT Broker**: Specify the local message topics.
       - **Topic**: Input `local/topic/egress`.

     - **Remote MQTT Broker**: Specify the target topics on the remote broker.
       - **Topic**: Input `remote/topic/egress`.
       - **QoS**: Select `0` or `${qos}` (to use the QoS of the received messages).
       - **Retain**: Confirm whether the message will be published as a retained message.
       - **Payload**: Payload template for the messages to be forwarded, and Supports reading data using `${field}` syntax.

     - **Pool size**: Introduced in 5.1, this option specifies the size of the pool of MQTT clients that will publish messages to the remote broker, we'll set `8` to make use of available parallelism.

7. In **Query mode** field, you can configure whether to use sync/async mode and your buffer pool size as your business needs.

7. Before clicking **Create**, you can click **Test Connectivity** to test that the bridge can connect to the MQTT broker.

8. Click **Create** to finish the creation of the data bridge.

### Create MQTT Data Bridge via Configuration File

EMQX also supports to use configuration file to create an MQTT data bridge, and an example is as follows:

```bash
bridges.mqtt.my_mqtt_bridge {
  enable = true
  server = "broker.emqx.io:1883"
  username = "emqx_u"
  password = "public"
  proto_ver = "v4"
  clean_start = true
  keepalive = "60s"

  egress {
    local {topic = "local/topic/egress"}
    remote {
      payload = "${payload}"
      qos = 1
      retain = true
      topic = "remote/topic/egress"
    }
    pool_size = 8
  }
  ingress {
    local {
      topic = "$share/g/remote/topic/ingress"
      qos = 1
      payload = "${payload}"
    }
    remote {qos = 1, topic = "local/topic/ingress"}
    pool_size = 8
  }
}
```

## Features

### MQTT Client pools

Both for **ingress** and **egress** mode EMQX employs a pool of MQTT clients. However, following the requirement of MQTT protocol, the _Client ID_ of each client should be unique. EMQX will pick a predictable _Client ID_ following the pattern:

```bash
[${ClientIDPrefix}:]${BridgeName}:${Mode}:${NodeName}:${N}
```

| Fragment             | Description                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `${ClientIDPrefix}`  | As per configuration. If not set then whole first fragment is omitted. |
| `${BridgeName}`      | User-provided name of the bridge. |
| `${Mode}`            | Either `ingress` or `egress`. |
| `${NodeName}`        | [Name of the node](../../configuration/cluster.html#node-names) on which the MQTT client is running. |
| `${N}`               | Number from `1` to the configured size of the MQTT client pool. |

### Using MQTT Client pool for ingress

As a kind of safety measure, EMQX will start a MQTT client pool for the **ingress** mode when the configuration for the Remote MQTT Broker's **Topic** contains _shared subscription topic_ (e.g. `$share/name1/topic1`) or _topic-filter_ (e.g. `$share/name2/topic2/#`). Otherwise, only a single MQTT client will be started. This is to avoid the situation where each message pertaining to the configured topic is received by all MQTT clients in the pool, which would result in a lot of duplicate messages. However, currently no such safety measure exists for the EMQX cluster as a whole, meaning that there will be one MQTT client _per cluster node_. This will lead to situations where remote broker's messages will be duplicated _cluster size_ times before processing.

All in all, configuring **ingress** with _shared subscription topic_ or _topic-filter_ for the remote broker's topic is strongly advised.
