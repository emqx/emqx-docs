# Save data to OpenTSDB

Setup a OpenTSDB database, taking Mac OSX for instance:

```bash
$ docker pull petergrace/opentsdb-docker

$ docker run -d --name opentsdb -p 4242:4242 petergrace/opentsdb-docker
```

Create a rule:

Go to [EMQX Dashboard](http://127.0.0.1:18083/#/rules), select the
"rule" tab on the menu to the left.

Select "message.publish", then type in the following SQL:

```bash
SELECT
    payload.metric as metric, payload.tags as tags, payload.value as value
FROM
    "message.publish"
```

Bind an action:

Click on the "+ Add" button under "Action Handler", and then select
"Data to OpenTSDB" in the pop-up dialog window.

Fill in the parameters required by the action:

Six parameters is required by action "Data to OpenTSDB":

1). Details. Whether let OpenTSDB Server return the failed data point
and their error reason, defaults to false.

2). Summary. Whether let OpenTSDB Server return data point
success/failure count, defaults to true.

3). Max Batch Size. In case of heavy traffic, how many data points are
allowed to be included in a single request. Default to 20.

4). Sync Call. Defaults to false.

5). Sync Timeout. Defaults to 0.

6). Bind a resource to the action. Since the dropdown list "Resource"
is empty for now, we create a new resource by clicking on the "New
Resource" to the top right, and then select "OpenTSDB":

Configure the resource:

Keep all the default configs as default, and click on the "Testing
Connection" button to make sure the connection can be created
successfully, and then click on the "Create" button.

Back to the "Actions" dialog, and then click on the "Confirm"
    button.

Back to the creating rule page, then click on "Create" button. The
    rule we created will be show in the rule list:

We have finished, testing the rule by sending an MQTT message to
    emqx:

```bash
> Topic: "t/1"
>
> QoS: 0
>
> Retained: false
>
> Payload: {"metric":"cpu","tags":{"host":"serverA"},"value":12}
```

Then inspect the OpenTSDB table, verify a new record has been
inserted:

```bash
## Use postman to send an HTTP request to the opentsdb server:
POST /api/query HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:4242
Content-Type: application/json
cache-control: no-cache
Postman-Token: 69af0565-27f8-41e5-b0cd-d7c7f5b7a037
{
    "start": 1560409825000,
    "queries": [
        {
            "aggregator": "last",
            "metric": "cpu",
            "tags": {
                "host": "*"
            }
        }
    ],
    "showTSUIDs": "true",
    "showQuery": "true",
    "delete": "false"
}
------WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW--
```
The response should look like following:

```json
[
  {
      "metric": "cpu",
      "tags": {
          "host": "serverA"
      },
      "aggregateTags": [],
      "query": {
          "aggregator": "last",
          "metric": "cpu",
          "tsuids": null,
          "downsample": null,
          "rate": false,
          "filters": [
              {
                  "tagk": "host",
                  "filter": "*",
                  "group_by": true,
                  "type": "wildcard"
              }
          ],
          "index": 0,
          "tags": {
              "host": "wildcard(*)"
          },
          "rateOptions": null,
          "filterTagKs": [
              "AAAC"
          ],
          "explicitTags": false
      },
      "tsuids": [
          "000002000002000007"
      ],
      "dps": {
          "1561532453": 12
      }
  }
]
```

And from the rule list, verify that the "Matched" column has increased
to 1:
