# Get subscription relationship from MongoDB

Set up the MongoDB database and set the user name and password to root/public. Take MacOS X as an example:
```bash
$ brew install mongodb
$ brew services start mongodb

## Add root/public user
$ use mqtt;
$ db.createUser({user: "root", pwd: "public", roles: [{role: "readWrite", db: "mqtt"}]});

## Modify the configuration and disable anonymous authentication
$ vi /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf

    security:
    authorization: enabled

$ brew services restart mongodb
```

Create the mqtt_sub table:
```sql
$ mongo 127.0.0.1/mqtt -uroot -ppublic
db.createCollection("mqtt_sub");
```

Create rules:

Open [EMQX Dashboard](http://127.0.0.1:18083/#/rules) and select the "Rules" tab on the left.

Then fill in the rule SQL:

```sql
SELECT * FROM "$events/client_connected"
```
