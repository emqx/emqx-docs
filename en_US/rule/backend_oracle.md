Fill in the action parameters:

The "Save data to Oracle Database" action requires two parameters:

1). SQL template. In this example, we insert a piece of data into Oracle Database. The SQL template is:

```sql
INSERT INTO T_MQTT_MSG (MSGID, TOPIC, QOS, PAYLOAD) values ('${id}', '${topic}', '${qos}', '${payload}');
```

2). The ID of the associated resource. Now that the resource drop-down box is empty, and you can click "New Resource" in the upper right corner to create an Oracle Database resource:

Fill in the resource configuration:

Note: for the connection to Oracle Real Applications Cluster (RAC) to work properly, the "Service Name" field must be filled correctly.  If left empty, it defaults to the Database SID.

Click the "New" button.

Return to the response action interface and click "OK".
