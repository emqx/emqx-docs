# Get subscription relationship from PostgreSQL 

Set up the PostgreSQL database, and take MacOS X as an example:
```bash
$ brew install postgresql
$ brew services start postgresql
```

Create the mqtt database:

```
# Create a database named 'mqtt' with the username postgres
$ createdb -U postgres mqtt

$ psql -U postgres mqtt

mqtt=> \dn;
List of schemas
Name  | Owner
--------+-------
public | postgres
(1 row)
```

Create the mqtt_sub table:

```sql
$ psql -U postgres mqtt
CREATE TABLE mqtt_sub(
  id SERIAL8 primary key,
  clientid character varying(64),
  topic character varying(255),
  qos integer,
  UNIQUE (clientid, topic)
);
```
