# Data Integration

Data integration is a channel used to connect EMQX and external data systems, for example, databases like MySQL, MongoDB, message brokers like Apache Kafka and RabbitMQ, or even an HTTP server.

This chapter introduces the supported external data systems, how to set up the data bridge, how to create a rule for data forwarding, and how to test the data bridge and rules you just created. 

Currently, the following are supported:

- [Bridge Data into MQTT Broker](../rule/bridge_mqtt.md)
- [Steam Data into Kafka](../rule/bridge_kafka.md)
- [Ingest Data into InfluxDB](../rule/backend_influxdb.md)
