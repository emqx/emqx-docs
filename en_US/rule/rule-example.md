# Rule engine example


{% emqxce %}
::: danger
Only the following operations are applicable in EMQ X Broker:
- Check (debug)
- Send data to web service
- Bridge data to MQTT Broker


The rest are exclusive to EMQ X Enterprise.
:::
{% endemqxce %}



## Check (debug)

Create a rule for testing: print the content of the message and all the
args of the action, when a MQTT message is sent to topic 't/a'.

- The filter SQL is: SELECT \* FROM "message.publish" WHERE topic =
  't/a';
- The action is: "print the content of the message and all the args of
  the action", the action we need is 'inspect'.

<!-- end list -->

```bash
$ ./bin/emqx_ctl rules create \
  "SELECT * FROM \"message.publish\" WHERE topic = 't/a'" \
  '[{"name":"inspect", "params": {"a": 1}}]' \
  -d 'Rule for debug'

Rule rule:803de6db created
```

The CLI above created a rule with ID='Rule rule:803de6db'.

The first two args are mandatory:

- SQL: SELECT \* FROM "message.publish" WHERE topic = 't/a'
- Action List: \[{"name":"inspect", "params": {"a": 1}}\]. Action List
  is of tye JSON Array. "name" is the name of the action, "params" is
  the parameters of the action. Note that the action `inspect` does
  not need a resource.

The last arg is an optional description of the rule: 'Rule for debug'.

If a MQTT message "hello" is sent to topic 't/a', the rule "Rule
rule:803de6db" will be matched, and then action "inspect" will be
triggered, the following info will be printed to the emqx console:

```bash
$ tail -f log/erlang.log.1

(emqx@127.0.0.1)1> [inspect]
Selected Data: #{client_id => <<"shawn">>,event => 'message.publish',
                    flags => #{dup => false,retain => false},
                    id => <<"5898704A55D6AF4430000083D0002">>,
                    payload => <<"hello">>,
                    peername => <<"127.0.0.1:61770">>,qos => 1,
                    timestamp => 1558587875090,topic => <<"t/a">>,
                    username => undefined}
Envs: #{event => 'message.publish',
        flags => #{dup => false,retain => false},
        from => <<"shawn">>,
        headers =>
            #{allow_publish => true,
                peername => {{127,0,0,1},61770},
                username => undefined},
        id => <<0,5,137,135,4,165,93,106,244,67,0,0,8,61,0,2>>,
        payload => <<"hello">>,qos => 1,
        timestamp => {1558,587875,89754},
        topic => <<"t/a">>}
Action Init Params: #{<<"a">> => 1}
```

- `Selected Data` listed the fields that selected by the SQL.All
  available fields will be listed here, as we used `select *`.
- `Envs` is the environment variables that can be used internally in
  the action.
- `Action Init Params` is the params we passed to the action.




## Create WebHook Rules

Setup a Web Service, here we set up a simple web service using the Linux tool `nc`:
```bash
$ while true; do echo -e "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\n $(date)" | nc -l 127.0.0.1 9901; done;
```

Create a rule:

Go to [emqx dashboard](http://127.0.0.1:18083/#/rules), select the
"rule" tab on the menu to the left.

Select "message.publish", then type in the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM
    "message.publish"
```
![image](./assets/rule-engine/mysql_sql_1.png)

Bind an action:

Click on the "+ Add" button under "Action Handler", and then select
"Data to Web Server" in the pop-up dialog window.

![image](./assets/rule-engine/webhook_action_0.png)

Bind a resource to the action:

Since the dropdown list "Resource" is empty for now, we create a new
resource by clicking on the "New Resource" at the top right, and then
select "WebHook":

![image](./assets/rule-engine/webhook_action_1.png)

Configure the resource:

Fill in the "Request URL" and "Request Header"(Optional):

    http://127.0.0.1:9901

And click on the "Testing Connection" button to make sure the
connection can be created successfully, and then click on the "Create"
button.

![image](./assets/rule-engine/webhook_resource_0.png)

Back to the "Actions" dialog, and then click on the "Confirm"
    button.

![image](./assets/rule-engine/webhook_action_2.png)

Back to the creating rule page, click the "Create" button. The
    rule we created will be shown in the rule list:

![image](./assets/rule-engine/webhook_rule_rule_overview_0.png)

We have finished, testing the rule by sending an MQTT message to
    emqx:

```bash
> Topic: "t/1"
>
> QoS: 1
>
> Payload: "Hello web server"
```

Then inspect the Web Service table, and verify a new record has been
received:

![image](./assets/rule-engine/webhook_result.png)

And from the rule list, verify that the "Matched" column has increased
to 1:

![image](./assets/rule-engine/webhook_rule_rule_overview_1.png)

## Create BridgeMQTT Rules

Set up another MQTT broker using mosquitto, and change the port to 2883.
    Take Mac OSX for instance:

```bash
$ brew install mosquitto

$ vim /usr/local/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf

port 2883

# start mosquitto
$ brew services start mosquitto
```

Create a rule:

Go to [emqx dashboard](http://127.0.0.1:18083/#/rules), select the
"rule" tab on the menu to the left.

Select "message.publish", then type in the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM
    "message.publish"
```

![image](./assets/rule-engine/mysql_sql_1.png)

Bind an action:

    Click on the "+ Add" button under "Action Handler", and then select
    "Data bridge to MQTT Broker" in the pop-up dialog window.

![image](./assets/rule-engine/mqtt_action_0.png)

Bind a resource to the action. Since the dropdown list "Resource" is
    empty for now, we create a new resource by clicking on the "New
    Resource" to the top right, and then select "MQTT Bridge":

![image](./assets/rule-engine/mqtt_action_1.png)

Configure the resource:

    Set "Broker Address" to the address of mosquitto, here is
    127.0.0.1:2883, and keep all other configs as default, and click on
    the "Testing Connection" button to make sure the connection can be
    created successfully, and then click on the "Create" button.

![image](./assets/rule-engine/mqtt_resource_0.png)

Back to the "Actions" dialog, and then click on the "Confirm"
    button.

![image](./assets/rule-engine/mqtt_action_2.png)

Back to the creating rule page, click the "Create" button. The
    rule we created will be shown in the rule list:

![image](./assets/rule-engine/mqtt_rule_overview_0.png)

We have finished, testing the rule by sending an MQTT message to
    emqx:

```bash
> Topic: "t/1"
>
> QoS: 0
>
> Retained: false
>
> Payload: "Hello, World\!"
```

Then verify a message has been published to mosquitto:

![image](./assets/rule-engine/rpc_result.png)

And from the rule list, verify that the "Matched" column has increased
to 1:

## Create MySQL Rules

Setup a MySQL database, and change the username/password to root/public, taking Mac OSX for instance:

```bash
$ brew install mysql

$ brew services start mysql

$ mysql -u root -h localhost -p

ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'public';
```

Initiate MySQL table:

```bash
$ mysql -u root -h localhost -ppublic

create "test" database:

CREATE DATABASE test;

create "t_mqtt_msg" table:

USE test;
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE `t_mqtt_msg` (
    `id` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    `msgid` varchar(64) DEFAULT NULL,
    `topic` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    `qos` tinyint(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
    `payload` blob,
    `arrived` datetime NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
    INDEX topic_index(`id`, `topic`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8MB4;
```

![image](./assets/rule-engine/mysql_init_1.png)


Create a rule:

Go to [emqx dashboard](http://127.0.0.1:18083/#/rules), and select the "rule" tab on the menu to the left.

```sql
SELECT * FROM "message.publish"
```

![image](./assets/rule-engine/mysql_sql_1.png)

Bind an action:

Click on the "+ Add" button under "Action Handler", and then select
"Data to MySQL" in the pop-up dialog window.

![image](./assets/rule-engine/mysql_action_1.png)

Fill in the parameters required by the action:

Two parameters are required by action "Data to MySQL":

1). SQL template. SQL template is the sql command you'd like to run
when the action is triggered. In this example, we'll insert a message
into mysql, so type in the following sql
template:

```sql
insert into t_mqtt_msg(msgid, topic, qos, payload, arrived) values (${id}, ${topic}, ${qos}, ${payload}, FROM_UNIXTIME(${timestamp}/1000))
```

Before data is inserted into the table, placeholders like \${key} will
be replaced by the corresponding values.

![image](./assets/rule-engine/mysql_action_2.png)

2). Bind a resource to the action. Since the dropdown list "Resource"
is empty for now, we create a new resource by clicking on the "New
Resource" to the top right, and then select "MySQL":

![image](./assets/rule-engine/mysql_action_3.png)

Configure the resource:

Set "MySQL Database" to "test", "MySQL Username" to "root", "MySQL
Password" to "public", and "Description" to "MySQL resource to
127.0.0.1:3306 db=test", and click on the "Testing Connection" button
to make sure the connection can be created successfully, and then
click on the "Create" button.

## Create PostgreSQL Rules

Setup a PostgreSQL database, taking Mac OSX for instance:

```bash
$ brew install postgresql

$ brew services start postgresql

## create root user
$ createuser --interactive --pwprompt
Enter name of role to add: root
Enter password for new role: public
Enter it again: public
Shall the new role be a superuser? (y/n) y

## create database named 'mqtt' using root
$ createdb -U root mqtt

$ psql -U root mqtt

mqtt=> \dn;
List of schemas
Name  | Owner
--------+-------
public | shawn
(1 row)
```

Initiate PgSQL table:

```bash
\$ psql -U root mqtt
```

create `t_mqtt_msg` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t_mqtt_msg (
    id SERIAL primary key,
    msgid character varying(64),
    sender character varying(64),
    topic character varying(255),
    qos integer,
    retain integer,
    payload text,
    arrived timestamp without time zone
);
```

Create a rule:

Go to [emqx dashboard](http://127.0.0.1:18083/#/rules), select the "Rule" tab on the menu to the left.

Select "message.publish", then type in the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT
 *
FROM
 "message.publish"
```

![image](./assets/rule-engine/mysql_sql_1.png)

Bind an action:

Click on the "+ Add" button under "Action Handler", and then select
"Data to PostgreSQL" in the pop-up dialog window.

![image](./assets/rule-engine/pgsql_action_0.png)

Two parameters are required by action "Data to PostgreSQL":

1). SQL template. SQL template is the sql command you'd like to run
when the action is triggered. In this example, we'll insert a message
into pgsql, so type in the following sql
template:

```sql
insert into t_mqtt_msg(msgid, topic, qos, retain, payload, arrived) values (${id}, ${topic}, ${qos}, ${retain}, ${payload}, to_timestamp(${timestamp}::double precision /1000)) returning id
```

Before data is inserted into the table, placeholders like \${key} will
be replaced by the corresponding values.

![image](./assets/rule-engine/pgsql_action_1.png)

2). Bind a resource to the action. Since the dropdown list "Resource"
is empty for now, we create a new resource by clicking on the "New
Resource" to the top right, and then select "PostgreSQL":

![image](./assets/rule-engine/pgsql_resource_0.png)

Select "PostgreSQL Resource".

Configure the resource:

Set "PostgreSQL Database" to "mqtt", "PostgreSQL User" to "root", and
keep all other configs as default, and click on the "Testing
Connection" button to make sure the connection can be created
successfully.

Finally, click on the "Create" button.

Fill in the parameters required by the action:

Two parameters are required by action "Data to MongoDB":

1). The mongodb collection. Set it to "t_mqtt_msg" we just created.

2). Selector template. Selector template is the keys and values you'd
like to insert into mongodb when the action is triggered. In this
example we'll insert a message into mongodb, so type in the following
sql
template:

```sql
msgid=${id},topic=${topic},qos=${qos},payload=${payload},retain=${retain},arrived=${timestamp}
```

Before data is inserted into the table, placeholders like \${key} will
be replaced by the corresponding values.

![image](./assets/rule-engine/mongo_action_1.png)

3). Bind a resource to the action. Since the dropdown list "Resource"
is empty for now, we create a new resource by clicking on the "New
Resource" to the top right, and then select "MongoDB Single Mode":

![image](./assets/rule-engine/mongo_action_2.png)

Configure the resource:

Set "Database Name" to "mqtt", "Username" to "root", "Password" to

## Create DynamoDB Rules

Setup a DynamoDB database, taking Mac OSX for instance:

```bash
$ brew install dynamodb-local

$ dynamodb-local
```

Initiate the DynamoDB table:

1). Create table definition file "mqtt_msg.json" for DynamoDB:

```json
{
    "TableName": "mqtt_msg",
    "KeySchema": [
        { "AttributeName": "msgid", "KeyType": "HASH" }
    ],
    "AttributeDefinitions": [
        { "AttributeName": "msgid", "AttributeType": "S" }
    ],
    "ProvisionedThroughput": {
        "ReadCapacityUnits": 5,
        "WriteCapacityUnits": 5
    }
}
```

2). Create the DynamoDB
table:

Four parameters are required by action "Data to DynamoDB":

1). DynamoDB Table. Here set it to "mqtt_msg".

2). Hash Key. Here set it to "msgid".

3). DynamoDB Range Key. Leave it empty as we didn't define a range key
in the dynamodb definition file.

![image](./assets/rule-engine/dynamo_action_1.png)

4). Bind a resource to the action. Since the dropdown list "Resource"
is empty for now, we create a new resource by clicking on the "New
Resource" to the top right, and then select "DynamoDB":

![image](./assets/rule-engine/dynamo_action_2.png)

Configure the resource:

Fill in the configs as follows:

    emqx:

```bash
> Topic: "t/1"
>
> QoS: 0
>
> Retained: false
>
> Payload: "hello"
```

Then inspect the Redis table, and verify a new record has been inserted:

```bash
\$ redis-cli

127.0.0.1:6379\> KEYS mqtt:msg\*

127.0.0.1:6379\> hgetall <key\>
```

```bash
$ docker pull timescale/timescaledb

$ docker run -d --name timescaledb -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password timescale/timescaledb:latest-pg11

$ docker exec -it timescaledb psql -U postgres

## create tutorial database
> CREATE database tutorial;

> \c tutorial

> CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS timescaledb CASCADE;
```

Initiate the TimescaleDB table:

```bash
$ docker exec -it timescaledb psql -U postgres -d tutorial

CREATE TABLE conditions (
    time        TIMESTAMPTZ       NOT NULL,
    location    TEXT              NOT NULL,
    temperature DOUBLE PRECISION  NULL,
    humidity    DOUBLE PRECISION  NULL
);

SELECT create_hypertable('conditions', 'time');

```

Create a rule:

Go to [emqx dashboard](http://127.0.0.1:18083/#/rules), select the
"rule" tab on the menu to the left.

Select "message.publish", then type in the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT

1). SQL template. SQL template is the sql command you'd like to run
when the action is triggered. In this example, we'll insert a message
into timescaledb, so type in the following sql
template:

```sql
insert into conditions(time, location, temperature, humidity) values (NOW(), ${location}, ${temp}, ${humidity})
```

Before data is inserted into the table, placeholders like \${key} will
be replaced by the corresponding values.

![image](./assets/rule-engine/timescaledb_action_1.png)

2). Bind a resource to the action. Since the dropdown list "Resource"
is empty for now, we create a new resource by clicking on the "New
Resource" to the top right, and then select "TimescaleDB":

![image](./assets/rule-engine/timescaledb_action_1.png)

Configure the resource:

Set "TimescaleDB Database" to "tutorial", "TimescaleDB User" to
"postgres", "TimescaleDB Password" to "password", and keep all other
configs as default, and click on the "Testing Connection" button to
make sure the connection can be created successfully, and then click

>
> Payload: {"temp":24,"humidity":30,"location":"hangzhou"}
```

Then inspect the TimescaleDB table, and verify a new record has been
inserted:

 tutorial=\# SELECT \* FROM conditions LIMIT 100;

The output data could look like

 this:
```bash
    time              | location | temperature | humidity

 \------------------------------+----------+-------------+----------2019-06-27
 01:41:08.752103+00 | hangzhou | 24 | 30
