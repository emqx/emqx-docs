# Authentication and Authorization

Authentication refers to the process of verifying the identity of a client when connecting to an MQTT broker. Authorization, on the other hand, involves granting the appropriate access levels and permissions to authenticated clients. By employing authentication mechanisms and fine-grained authorization, you can ensure that only authorized clients can connect to your MQTT broker and perform specific operations.

This page contains learning resources for exploring the concepts of authentication and authorization and how to ensure the security of MQTT messaging systems through authentication mechanisms.
