# TLS

TLS is an encryption protocol that ensures secure communication over networks, providing privacy, data integrity, and identity authentication. It establishes an encrypted connection between clients and servers, preventing eavesdropping, tampering, and unauthorized access.

This page collects all kinds of online resources for exploring the concepts and functionalities of Transport Layer Security (TLS) and how to apply them to MQTT messaging systems.
