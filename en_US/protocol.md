# Protocol 

## Overview 

MQTT is a lightweight publish-subscribe mode messaging protocol which is designed for IoT applications in low-bandwidth and unstable network environments. 

MQTT official website: [http://mqtt.org](http://mqtt.org)

MQTT V3.1.1 protocol specification: [http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/os/mqtt-v3.1.1-os.html](http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/os/mqtt-v3.1.1-os.html)

## Feature 

  1. Open message protocol that is easy to implement 
  2. publish-subscribe mode，one-to-many message publishing 
  3. Based on TCP/IP network connection 
  4. Compact message structure with 1 byte of fixed header and 2 bytes of heartbeat message, 
  5. Message QoS support with reliable transmission guarantee 



## Application 

MQTT protocol is widely used in Internet of Things, Mobile Internet, Intelligent Hardware,Internet of Vehicles, Power Energy and so on. 

  1. M2M Communication and Big Data Acquisition in the Internet of Things 
  2. Android message push and WEB message push 
  3. Mobile instant messaging, such as Facebook Messenger 
  4. Intelligent hardware, smart furniture and appliances 
  5. Vehicle networking communication, pile collection of electric vehicles 
  6. Smart City, Telemedicine, Distance Education 
  7. Electricity, Oil and Energy industry 



## Topic-based Message Routing of MQTT 

The MQTT protocol routes messages based on Topic, which is similar to URL paths, for example: 
    
    
    chat/room/1
    
    sensor/10/temperature
    
    sensor/+/temperature
    
    $SYS/broker/metrics/packets/received
    
    $SYS/broker/metrics/#

Topic distinguishes the hierarchy by '/' and supports the wildcard of'+' and '#' : 
    
    
    '+': indicates a single level of wildcard , such as a/+ matching a/x or a/y
    
    '#': indicates multiple levels of wildcards，such as a/# matching a/x, a/b/c/d

Subscribers and publishers communicate via topic routing messages, such as using the mosquitto command line to publish subscribed messages: 
    
    
    mosquitto_sub -t a/b/+ -q 1
    
    mosquitto_pub -t a/b/c -m hello -q 1

::: tip Tip
Subscribers are allowed to subscribe to wildcard-containing topics, but publishers are not allowed to publish messages to wildcard-containing topics.

## MQTT V3.1.1 Protocol Packet 

### Packet structure 

- Fixed header                  
- Variable header) 
- Payload          



### Fixed header 
    +----------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
    | Bit      |  7  |  6  |  5  |  4  |  3  |  2  |  1  |  0  |
    +----------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
    | byte1    |   MQTT Packet type    |         Flags         |
    +----------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
    | byte2... |   Remaining Length                            |
    +----------+-----------------------------------------------+   



### Packet type 

Name        |  Value |  Description            
------------|--------|-------------------------
CONNECT     |  1     |  Initiate a connection  
CONNACK     |  2     |  Connection receipt     
PUBLISH     |  3     |  Publish message        
PUBACK      |  4     |  Publish receipt        
PUBREC      |  5     |  QoS2 message receipt   
PUBREL      |  6     |  QoS 2message release   
PUBCOMP     |  7     |  QoS2 message finish    
SUBSCRIBE   |  8     |  Subscribe to topics    
SUBACK      |  9     |  Subscribe to receipt   
UNSUBSCRIBE |  10    |  Unsubscribe            
UNSUBACK    |  11    |  Unsubscribe to receipt 
PINGREQ     |  12    |  PING request           
PINGRESP    |  13    |  PING response          
DISCONNECT  |  14    |  Disconnected           



### publish message by PUBLISH 

The PUBLISH packet carries a two-way published message between the client and the server. The PUBACK packet is used to confirm the QoS1 message, and the PUBREC/PUBREL/PUBCOMP packet is used for the QoS2 message flow. 

### PINGREQ/PINGRESP heartbeat 

When no packet is sent, the client sends a PINGREQ heartbeat packet to the server according to the keepalive period. The server responds to the PINGRESP packet. THe sizes of PINGREQ/PINGRESP packet are both 2 bytes。 

## MQTT Message QoS 

MQTT message QoS guarantee is between the client and the server. The QoS level at which the subscriber receives the MQTT message ultimately depends on the QoS of the published message and the QoS of the topic subscription. 

QoS to publish message |  QoS of topic subscription |  QoS to receive message 
-----------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------
 0 | 0 | 0      
 0 | 1 | 0      
 0 | 2 | 0      
 1 | 0 | 0      
 1 | 1 | 1      
 1 | 2 | 1      
 2 | 0 | 0      
 2 | 1 | 1      
 2 | 2 | 2

## MQTT Clean Session 

When the MQTT client initiates a CONNECT request to the server, the session can be set via the 'Clean Session' flag. 

'Clean Session' is set to 0, which means that a persistent session is created. When the client is disconnected, the session still keeps and saves the offline message until the session times out. 

'Clean Session' is set to 1, which means that a new temporary session is created, and the session is automatically destroyed when the client is disconnected. 

## MQTT connection keep-alive heartbeat 

When the MQTT client initiates a CONNECT request to the server, the keepalive period is set by the KeepAlive parameter. 

When no packet is sent, the client sends a 2-byte PINGREQ heartbeat packet periodically according to the KeepAlive period. After receiving the PINGREQ packet, the server replies with a 2-byte PINGRESP packet. 

During the 1.5 heartbeat periods, if the server does not receive the client's subscription message or the PINGREQ heartbeat message, the TCP connection of client is disconnected by the active heartbeat timeout. 

::: tip Tip
The timeout of emqttd broker is set to a maximum of 2.5 heartbeat cycle by default. 
:::

## MQTT Last Will 

When the MQTT client makes a CONNECT request to the server, it can set whether to send the flag of Will Message , as well as the Topic and Payload. 

When the MQTT client is abnormally offline (the DISCONNECT message is not sent to the server before the client disconnects), the MQTT message server will publish a will message. 

## MQTT Retained Message 

When the MQTT client publishes a message to the server, Retained Message flag can be set. The Retained Message resides on the message server, and subsequent subscribers can still receive the message when they subscribe to the topic. 

For example, the mosquitto command line publishes a reserved message to the topic'a/b/c': 
    
    
    mosquitto_pub -r -q 1 -t a/b/c -m 'hello'

If the subsequent MQTT client subscribes to the topic 'a/b/c', the message can still be received: 
    
    
    $ mosquitto_sub -t a/b/c -q 1
    hello

There are two ways to clear a Retained Message: 

  1. The client publishes an empty message to the topic with the reserved message:: 
    
         mosquitto_pub -r -q 1 -t a/b/c -m ''

  2. The broker sets the expiration time for the reserved message. 




## MQTT WebSocket connection 

In addition to supporting the TCP transport layer, the MQTT protocol also supports websockets as the transport layer. The WebSocket browser enables direct connection to the MQTT messaging server and communicate with other MQTT clients through publish-subscribe mode. 

The the binary mode must be used in WebSocket connection of the MQTT protocol with the sub-protocol Header: 
    
    
    Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: mqttv3.1 或 mqttv3.1.1

## Comparison between MQTT and XMPP protocols 

The MQTT protocol has the features of simple, lightweight, and flexible in routing. It will completely replace the XMPP protocol in the PC era in the field of mobile Internet and IoT messaging: 

  1. The MQTT protocol has a fixed byte header and a two-byte heartbeat packet. The size is small and easy to decode. The XMPP protocol is based on heavy XML, with large packet size is large and cumbersome interaction. 
  2. The MQTT protocol is based on topic publish-subscribe message routing which is more flexible than XMPP's jid-based point-to-point message routing. 
  3. The MQTT protocol does not define a packet format and can carry different types of packets such as JSON and binary. The XMPP protocol uses XML to carry messages, and the binary must be processed by Base64 encoding. 
  4. The MQTT protocol supports messaging receipt and QoS guarantees, and the XMPP master protocol does not define a similar mechanism. The MQTT protocol has better message reliability guarantees. 



## MQTT-SN Protocol 

MQTT-SN stands for "MQTT for Sensor Networks" which aims at embedded devices on non-TCP/IP networks, such as ZIGBEE. Its offical site says: 

MQTT-SN is a publish/subscribe messaging protocol for wireless sensor networks (WSN), with the aim of extending the MQTT protocol beyond the reach of TCP/IP infrastructure for Sensor and Actuator solutions. 

MQTT-SN specification can be downloaded from [http://mqtt.org/new/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/MQTT-SN_spec_v1.2.pdf](http://mqtt.org/new/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/MQTT-SN_spec_v1.2.pdf) . 

## MQTT-SN vs MQTT 

MQTT-SN looks similar to MQTT in most parts, such as Will message, such as Connect/Subscribe/Publish command. 

The very difference between MQTT-SN and MQTT is the TopicId which replaces topic name in MQTT. TopicId is a 16 bits integer which stands for a topic name. Device and broker use REGISTER command to negotiate the mapping bewteen TopicId and topic name. 

MQTT-SN is able to update Will message, even delete it. But MQTT is not allowed to change Will which is set in CONNECT command only. 

MQTT-SN introduces gateways in its network. Gateway translates between MQTT-SN and MQTT, exchanges messages between device and MQTT broker. And there is a mechanism that called gateway discovery, which enables device to find gateways automatically. 

MQTT-SN supports sleeping client feature which allows device to shutdown itself to save power for a while. Gateway needs to buffer downlink publish messages for sleeping devices, and pushes these messages to devices once they are awake. 

## EMQX-SN Plugin 

EMQX-SN is an *EMQ X* plugin which implements most features of MQTT-SN. It serves as an MQTT-SN gateway on cloud, who is the neighbor of *EMQ X* Broker. 

### Configurations 

File: etc/plugins/emqx_sn.conf: 
    
    
    mqtt.sn.port = 1884
    
    mqtt.sn.advertise_duration = 900
    
    mqtt.sn.gateway_id = 1
    
    mqtt.sn.username = mqtt_sn_user
    
    mqtt.sn.password = abc

mqtt.sn.port               |  The UDP port which emqx-sn is listening on.                                                                                                    
---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## LWM2M Protocol 

Lightweight M2M (LWM2M) is a set of protocols defined by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) for machine-to-machine (M2M) or Internet of Things (IoT) device management and communications. It can be found [ here](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/wp/) . 

LWM2M is based on CoAP protocol, and can be carried on UDP or SMS. 

There are two types of servers: 

  * LWM2M BOOTSTRAP SERVER. emqx-lwm2m does not support such kind of server. 
  * LWM2M SERVER. emqx-lwm2m implements most features of this server type, except for SMS binding. 



LWM2M defines service on a device as Object and Resource, which is represented in an XML file. A list of registered XML Objects can be found [ here](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/wp/OMNA/LwM2M/LwM2MRegistry.html) . 

## EMQX-LWM2M plugin 

EMQX-LWM2M is an *EMQ X* plugin，which implements most LWM2M features. MQTT client is able to access LWM2M device through EMQX-LWM2M plugin, by sending a command and reading its response. 

## Convertion between MQTT and LWM2M 

Commands from MQTT client to LWM2M device is carried in following topic: 
    
    
    "lwm2m/{?device_end_point_name}/command".

And MQTT Payload will be a json format data which specifies the command. Please refer to emqx-lwm2m document for details. 

Response from LWM2M device to MQTT client is carried in following topic: 
    
    
    "lwm2m/{?device_end_point_name}/response".

And MQTT payload will be a json format data which specifies the command. Please refer to emqx-lwm2m document for details. 

### Configurations 

File: etc/emqx_lwm2m.conf: 
    
    
    lwm2m.port = 5683
    
    lwm2m.certfile = etc/certs/cert.pem
    
    lwm2m.keyfile = etc/certs/key.pem
    
    lwm2m.xml_dir =  etc/lwm2m_xml

lwm2m.port     |  LWM2M udp port. Port 5783 is used to prevent conflict against emqx-coap 
---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
lwm2m.certfile |  DTLS certificate                                                        
lwm2m.keyfile  |  DTLS private key
