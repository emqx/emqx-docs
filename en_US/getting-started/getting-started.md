::: tab Run EMQX with Docker

Container deployment is the quickest way to start exploring EMQX. The instructions below show how to run EMQX with Docker. 

1. To download and start the latest version of EMQX, enter the command below.

   Ensure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is installed and running before you execute this command.

   {% emqxce %}
   
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name emqx -p 1883:1883 -p 8083:8083 -p 8084:8084 -p 8883:8883 -p 18083:18083 emqx/emqx:latest
   ```

   {% endemqxce %}

   {% emqxee %}
   
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name emqx -p 1883:1883 -p 8083:8083 -p 8084:8084 -p 8883:8883 -p 18083:18083 emqx/emqx-enterprise:latest
   ```

   {% endemqxee %}

::: tab Install EMQX with zip/tar.gz files

{% emqxce %}

You can also install EMQX with zip/tar.gz files on a computer or VM, so you can easily adjust the configurations or run performance tuning. The instructions below use [macOS](https://www.emqx.io/downloads?os=macOS) (macOS12 amd64) as an example to illustrate the installation steps.

Note: Considering all the runtime dependencies, it is recommended to use zip/tar.gz files for testing and hot upgrades, and **NOT** recommended in a production environment. 

1. To download the zip file, enter:

   ```bash
   wget https://www.emqx.com/en/downloads/broker/@CE_VERSION@/emqx-@CE_VERSION@-macos12-amd64.zip

## Use MQTTX to Verify Connection

Now that you have successfully started EMQX, you can continue to test the connection and message services with MQTTX.

[MQTTX](https://mqttx.app) is an elegant cross-platform MQTT 5.0 desktop client, running on macOS, Linux, and Windows. By utilizing a chat style of user interface, MQTTX allows users to quickly create connections and save multiple clients, which facilitates users to quickly test the MQTT/MQTTS connection, as well as the subscription and publication of MQTT messages.

This section introduces how to verify the connection with [MQTTX Web](https://mqttx.app/web), the browser-based MQTT 5.0 WebSocket client tool, with zero need to download or install any application. 

::: tip Prerequisites
The broker address and the port information should be prepared before testing the connection:

- **EMQX address**: The IP address of your server, in general.
- **Port**: Click **Management** -> **Listeners** from the left navigation menu in the Dashboard to get the port number.
:::

### Create a Connection

1. Click [MQTTX Web](http://www.emqx.io/online-mqtt-client#/recent_connections) to visit the browser-based MQTTX.

2. Configure and establish the MQTT connection. Click the **+ New Connection** button to enter the configure page: 

   - **Name**: Input a connection name, for example, `MQTTX_Test`.

   - **Host**

     - Select the protocol type via the drop-down list, for example, select `ws://` if the WebSockets protocol is adopted. MQTTX Web only supports WebSockets protocol. To test the SSL/TLS connection, download [MQTTX Desktop](https://mqttx.app/downloads).
     - Enter the EMQX address, for example, `emqx@127.0.0.1`.

   - **Port**: for example, `8083` is for the WebSockets protocol.

     Keep the default setting for the other fields or set it as your business needs. For a detailed explanation of different fields, see [MQTT User Manual - Connect](https://mqttx.app/docs/get-started).


3. Click the **Connect** button at the top right corner of the page.

### Publish and Subscribe to Topics

After the connection is successfully established, you can continue to subscribe to different topics and publish messages.

1. Click **+ New Subscription**. MQTTX Web has already filled in some fields, according to the setting, you will subscribe to topic `testtopic/#`  with QoS level of 0. You can repeat this step to subscribe to different topics, and MQTTX Web will differentiate topics with colors.

2. In the right corner of the chat area at the bottom, click the send icon to test the message publishing/receiving. The messages successfully sent will appear in the chat window.

If you want to continue the testing, such as one-way/two-way SSL authentication, and simulate test data with customized scripts, you can continue to explore with [MQTTX](https://mqttx.app). 

### View Metrics on Dashboard

On the Cluster Overview page in the EMQX Dashboard, you can check metrics such as **Connections**, **Topics**, **Subscriptions**, **Incoming Messages**, **Outgoing messages**, and **Dropped Messages**.
