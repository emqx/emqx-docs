- [Ubuntu, Debian installation](./install.md#ubuntu-debian)
- [MacOS, Windows, Linux ZIP installation](./install.md#zip-linux-macos-windows)

For other platforms which are not in the prebuilt list,
you may {% emqxce %}[build the runnables from source code](./install.md#source-code-compilation-and-installation) or{% endemqxce %}
simply [contact EMQ](https://www.emqx.com/en/contact) for support.

## Start EMQX

After the installation, you can start EMQX through the command of systemctl or emqx.
For more startup methods and precautions, please refer to [Starting EMQX](./start.md).

 {% emqxce %}
After EMQX is started successfully, you can visit [http://localhost:18083/](http://localhost:18083/)
(replace localhost with your actual IP address) through a browser to access [EMQX Dashboard](./dashboard.md)for device connection and related indicator monitoring and management.

{% endemqxee %}

### Start EMQX in the background

```bash
emqx start
```

After the startup is successful, you can use the `emqx ping` command to check the running status of the node.
If pong is returned, it means the running status is OK:

```bash
emqx ping
```

### Start EMQX using systemctl

```bash
sudo systemctl start emqx
```

Check if the service is working properly:

```bash
sudo systemctl status emqx
```

### Start EMQX using ZIP installation package

Switch to the EMQX decompression directory and execute the following command to start EMQX:

```bash
./bin/emqx start
```

In development mode, you can use the console command to start EMQX on the console and view
the startup and runtime logs printed to the console.

```bash
./bin/emqx console
```

## Quick verification using an MQTT client

After startup, you can quickly verify if EMQX is working by any MQTT client.
You can use the following client tools or client libraries to access EMQX

### Dashboard Websocket tool

EMQX dashboard comes with a builtin, websocket based MQTT client.

Open Dashboard and enter the page of **Tools -> Websocket**,
where you can use the MQTT over Websokcet client to quickly access EMQX.

The Websocket page provides you with a simple but effective WebSocket client tool,
which can be used for publishing, subscribing, and inspecting the messages.

### MQTTX desktop client tool

MQTTX is an elegant cross-platform MQTT 5.0 open source desktop client tool that
supports running on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

MQTTX has many features, provides a concise graphical interface and operation logic,
supports MQTT/MQTT over Websocket access and one-way/two-way SSL authentication,
and supports Payload format conversion, simulation of test data with a custom script,
automatic subscription of $SYS topic, viewing Traffic statistics and so on.

For download and use, please refer to the [MQTT X website](https://mqttx.app).

## Advanced operation

After completing the installation, startup, and access test,
you can now continue to read the following documents for a proper in-production setup.

### Authentication

Authentication is an important part of most applications,
and enabling authentication can effectively fence off malicious client connections.

Authorization rules, or Access Control List (ACL) can be configured to ensure only
legit clients are permitted to publish or subscribe to certain topics.

- [Authentication Introduction](../advanced/auth.md): Select a built-in plugin, to integrate
  with internal or external database, JWT or HTTP service as the authentication data source.
- [Authorization / ACL](../advanced/acl.md): Select a built-in plugin, to integrate with
  internal or external database, or HTTP service as the ACL data source.

### Rule Engine

The built-in SQL based rule-engine can extract, filter, enrich, and convert messages between
devices and data platofrms in real-time, and forward the data to Webhooks or other MQTT Brokers
without having to implement MQTT clients to do the job.

EMQX enterprise eidtion can also integrate with Kafka,
various SQL / NoSQL / time-series databases and enterprise systems, such as SAP.

- [Rule Engine](../rule/rule-engine.md): The concept and basic usage of rule engine.
- [Create Rule](../rule/rule-create.md): How to create a rule.
- [Example](../rule/rule-example.md#send data to-web-service): Tutorial on using various data
  sources for rule engine.

### HTTP API

HTTP API is a frequently used function in IoT platform development and EMQX operation and
maintenance. HTTP API can realize integration with external systems, such as querying and
managing client information, broker subscription, publishing messages and creating rules.

- [HTTP API](../advanced/http-api.md): include HTTP API access point and access
  authentication method.
- [Basic Information](../advanced/http-api.md#endpoint-brokers): Get basic information such as
  EMQX version and running status.
- [Node](../advanced/http-api.md#endpoint-nodes): Get the information of EMQX node.
- [Client](../advanced/http-api.md#endpoint-clients): View online client information and support
  kicking out the client.
- [Subscription Information](../advanced/http-api.md#endpoint-subscriptions): View the
  subscription topic list and subscription relationship.
- [Routes](../advanced/http-api.md#endpoint-routes): View subscribed topics.
- [Message Publishing](../advanced/http-api.md#endpoint-publish): Call EMQX through HTTP to
  publish MQTT messages, with a reliable way for applications to communicate with clients.
- [Topic Subscription](../advanced/http-api.md#endpoint-subscribe): Dynamically manage the client
  subscription list, without the need for the client to actively initiate
  subscription/unsubscription.
- [Plugins](../advanced/http-api.md#endpoint-plugins): Status management of plugins with
  start and stop operations.
