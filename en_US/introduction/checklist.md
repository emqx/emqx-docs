[EMQX Enterprise](https://www.emqx.com/en/products/emqx) is a powerful enterprise-level IoT MQTT messaging platform built by the people who develop the open source EMQX Broker.

EMQX Enterprise supports one-stop access to millions of IoT devices, MQTT&CoAP multi-protocol processing, and low-latency real-time communication. It maintains the simplicity and high performance of EMQX Broker, while adding many enterprise-level features:

- The connection performance is enhanced to millions or tens of millions. It supports private protocol and industry protocol customization, is compatible with old network equipment access based on TCP / UDP private protocol, and supports full network multi-protocol equipment access;
- It supports Redis, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB and other database message data persistence, with message conversion and written to multiple time series databases of InfluxDB, OpenTSDB, TimescaleDB. It supports automatic loading subscriptions from Redis or database, without the need for the initiation from client;
- Message bridging of message and stream middleware: forwarding of messages to Kafka stream processing middleware with 100,000/s High-performance and highly reliable , seamless integration with enterprise message middleware of RabbitMQ, Pulsar ;
- With global professional team technical support. Our team covers 5 branches in North America, Europe, and China. There are professional founding teams from Huawei, IBM, Amazon, and nearly ten partners in Europe, North America, and India, providing First-class technical support and consulting services.

### Rule engine

EMQX rules engine can flexibly process messages and events.

EMQX Enterprise version rules engine supports message re-publishing, bridging data to Kafka, Pulsar, RocketMQ, RabbitMQ, MQTT Broker, saving data to MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, DynamoDB, Cassandra, InfluxDB, OpenTSDB, TimescaleDB, and sending data to WebServer :

For the configuration of the rule engine, see the "Rules Engine" chapter for details.

### Schema Registry

Schema Registry
Currently, three formats of codec are supported: [Avro](https://avro.apache.org), [Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) and custom encoding. Among them, Avro and Protobuf are data formats that depend on Schema. The encoded data is binary, and the decoded data is map format. The decoded data can be directly used by the rule engine and other plugins. The user-defined (3rd-party) codec service uses HTTP or TCP callback to make it closer to business needs.

For codec related configuration, please refer to "Codec" chapter for details.
