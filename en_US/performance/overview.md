# Performance Tuning and Test

This chapter will introduce how to run performance tuning and test for EMQX. 

- [Performance Tuning](./tune.md)

  This section will introduce how to run performance tuning in Linux, covering topics like the Linus kernel tuning, TCP network tuning, Erlang VM tuning, and EMQX tuning. 

- [Performance Testing with eMQTT-Bench](./benchmark-emqtt-bench.md)

  This section will introduce how to install and use [emqtt_bench](https://github.com/emqx/emqtt_bench), the concise and powerful MQTT protocol performance testing tool. 

- [Performance Testing with XMeter Cloud](./benchmark-xmeter.md)

  This section will introduce how to use the fully managed MQTT load testing cloud service [XMeter Cloud](https://www.emqx.com/en/products/xmeter) and other tools to perform performance testing on EMQX.

- [EMQX Performance Reference](./performance-reference.md)

  This section lists the performance change curves of EMQX in several typical scenarios, and reveals the impact of factors such as QoS level and Payload size on the final performance.

:::tip

If you need testing services with large-scale scenarios and in-depth customization, the test service [XMeter](https://www.xmeter.net/) is recommended.
