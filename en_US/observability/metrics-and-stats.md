# Metrics

EMQX provides metrics monitoring functions, based on which the operation and maintenance personnel can monitor the current service status and troubleshoot possible system malfunctions. 

EMQX Broker provides users with multiple ways to view metrics and status. Most directly, users can see this data on the **Metrics** tab of the EMQX Dashboard.

If it is not convenient to access the Dashboard, they can also obtain these data through HTTP API and system topic messages. You can refer to [HTTP API](../admin/api.md) and [$SYS system topic](../mqtt/mqtt-system-topics.md).

## Integrate with monitor systems

EMQX supports integration with third-party monitoring systems, such as [StatsD](../observability/statsd.md) and [Prometheus](../observability/prometheus.md). Using a third-party monitoring system can bring the following advantages:

- A complete monitoring system, where the monitoring data of EMQX will be integrated with that of the other systems. For example, we can get the monitoring information of the server host;
- More intuitive monitoring report with figures and charts, such as using Grafana's dashboard;
- Various alarm notification means, such as using Prometheus's Alertmanager.

## Metrics & Stats

EMQX divides metrics into Metrics and Stats. 

- Metrics are data that increase monotonically, such as the number of sent bytes and messages. EMQX Metrics currently covers four dimensions: bytes, packets, messages, and events. 
- Stats appear in pairs, including current values and historical maximums, such as the current number of subscriptions and the historical maximum number of subscriptions.

### Metrics

In this section, we will elaborate on the four types of metrics, bytes, packets, messages, and events. 

#### Bytes
