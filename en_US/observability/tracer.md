### Notes

1. Up to 30 trace logs can be saved. 
2. Trace logs can generate a maximum of 512M logs per node. If the generated log file reaches the maximum, it will stop appending logs and give an alert in the main log file.
3. You can choose to stop logging manually, or wait until the end time to stop automatically.
4. The size of the log file viewed in the list is the sum of the uncompressed file sizes.
5. The EMQX cluster will continue an outstanding trace after restart.
6. If the dashboard download timeout, you can find the log file directly on the server's `data/trace`.
