# Incompatible Changes in EMQX 6.0

## 6.0.1

- [#16061](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/16061) Fixed an issue where RocketMQ actions ignored the configured payload template and sent the entire rule output instead.

  If you relied on the previous (incorrect) behavior, you may need to update your payload templates to ensure messages are formatted as expected.
